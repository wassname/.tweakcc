Send files to another Claude Code session — a peer session on this machine, or a Remote Control / cloud session on another machine. The receiving Claude gets the files on its own filesystem with @path references, plus your message.

Use this when a file is the thing to hand over — a doc with figures, a screenshot, a report, a build artifact. For plain text, use ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} instead. For agents inside this session (subagents, teammates), also use ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} — they share your filesystem and can read the file at its path directly.

\`to\` accepts a peer session name from ${LIST_AGENTS_TOOL_NAME}, or an explicit \`uds:<socket>\` / \`bridge:<session id>\` address.

Each file is capped at ${MAX_FILE_SIZE_MIB} MiB, at most ${MAX_FILES_PER_SEND} files per send. Files must exist on the local filesystem — write content to a file first if needed. The receiver verifies each file against a sha256 digest of what was sent (where the transport carries it) and refuses a mismatch with a visible note.

Example: ${SEND_FILE_TOOL_NAME}({ to: "devbox", files: ["report.pdf", "figures/plot.png"], message: "Here's the doc with figures." })
