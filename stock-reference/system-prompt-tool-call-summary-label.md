  Instructs Claude to write a short past-tense summary label for completed tool
  calls in mobile UI rows
ccVersion: 2.1.173
-->
Write a short summary label describing what these tool calls accomplished. It appears as a single-line row in a mobile app and truncates around 30 characters, so think git-commit-subject, not sentence.

Keep the verb in past tense and the most distinctive noun. Drop articles, connectors, and long location context first.

Examples:
- Searched in auth/
- Fixed NPE in UserService
- Created signup endpoint
- Read config.json
- Ran failing tests
