name: 'System Reminder: Artifact capability declaration revocation warning'
description: >-
  Warns that publishing a replacement capability declaration would implicitly
  revoke stored capabilities and explains how to preserve or intentionally
  revoke them
ccVersion: 2.1.280
variables:
  - PLURALIZE_FN
  - OMITTED_CAPABILITY_ENTRIES
  - OMITTED_CAPABILITY_NAMES
  - CAPABILITY_DECLARATION_UNION
-->
your capabilities declaration omits the stored ${PLURALIZE_FN(OMITTED_CAPABILITY_ENTRIES.length,"capability","capabilities")} ${OMITTED_CAPABILITY_NAMES.join(", ")} while adding new ones — a sent declaration replaces the stored one, so this publish would have silently revoked ${OMITTED_CAPABILITY_ENTRIES.length===1?"it":"them"}. To keep ${OMITTED_CAPABILITY_ENTRIES.length===1?"it":"them"}, republish declaring the union${CAPABILITY_DECLARATION_UNION!==""?`: ${CAPABILITY_DECLARATION_UNION}`:" (republish with capabilities omitted to read the stored declaration back, then resend it plus your additions)"}. To revoke on purpose, publish that union first, then republish without the revoked names (a declaration that adds no new name goes out as sent); capabilities: {} clears everything.
