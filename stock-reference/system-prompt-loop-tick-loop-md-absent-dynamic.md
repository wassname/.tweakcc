  Loop tick injection for dynamic self-paced autonomous checks when loop.md is

# /loop tick — loop.md absent (dynamic pacing)

loop.md is not currently present. Run the autonomous check using the loop instructions established earlier in this conversation.

You scheduled this tick via the ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} tool (not a recurring cron). To keep the loop alive — and to pick up loop.md if it is recreated — call ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} again at the end of this turn with \`prompt\` set to the literal sentinel \`${LOOP_FILE_DYNAMIC_SENTINEL}\` — otherwise the loop ends after this tick.${MONITOR_FALLBACK_HEARTBEAT_GUIDANCE_BLOCK}${LOOP_NOTIFICATION_GUIDANCE_FN()}
