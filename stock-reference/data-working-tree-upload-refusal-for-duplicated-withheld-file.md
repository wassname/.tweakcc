  Error refusing a working-tree upload because an index entry appeared holding
  byte-for-byte the content of a file that must stay on this machine, indicating
  something outside the upload wrote into its index copy

Not uploading this working tree: while it was read, an index entry appeared (${FORMAT_PATH_LIST_FN(SAME_BYTES_PATHS)}) holding, byte for byte, the content of a file that stays on this machine (named like credentials or keys${HAS_READ_RULES?", covered by a Read rule or a sandbox read-deny setting of yours, linked from your Claude Code configuration":""}, or kept by a git filter) — at a name no step of this upload put it under, so something else wrote into the index copy this upload works in while it ran. Retry; if it recurs, check what else is running in this checkout.
