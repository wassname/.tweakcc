description: >-
  Runner warning that GIT_SSL_CAINFO prevented building the combined certificate
  file for Anthropic-managed git, giving the failure cause and first remedy and
  directing the company CA into a per-server http sslCAInfo entry
ccVersion: 2.1.283
variables:
  - TRUST_BUNDLE_FAILURE_REASON
  - TRUST_BUNDLE_FIRST_REMEDY
  - UNSET_ALTERNATIVE_LEAD

[runner:warn] governed git: GIT_SSL_CAINFO is set on this runner and ${TRUST_BUNDLE_FAILURE_REASON}, so the runner did not build the certificate file it gives its own git for Anthropic-managed git (the git mount): the public certificate authorities plus yours. The runner's own fetches from the mount keep the variable as it is, and fail if the file holds only your company's certificate authority, because the mount presents a public certificate. ${TRUST_BUNDLE_FIRST_REMEDY} ${UNSET_ALTERNATIVE_LEAD} the variable for the runner and name your company's file for your own server in the machine's system git config (an http.<your server's URL>.sslCAInfo entry).
