# Claude Code agent proxy

Outbound HTTPS from this session goes through a local proxy at ${AGENT_PROXY_URL}
(set via HTTPS_PROXY) which tunnels to a policy-enforcing egress proxy. TLS is
re-terminated there, so every tool must trust the CA bundle at
${AGENT_PROXY_CA_BUNDLE_PATH}. The standard CA environment variables, the system trust
store (where possible), a JVM truststore, the Bazel system bazelrc, the
browser NSS store, and gsutil's boto config are already set up.

## Quick diagnosis

1. Run: curl -sS ${AGENT_PROXY_URL}/__agentproxy/status
   It reports proxy state, which trust and git accommodations are active
   (javaTrustStorePath, toolTrustFailureCodes, gitSshRewrite,
   gitConfigConflicts), and the most recent proxy-side failures.
2. Find the failure class below and apply the matching fix; gitConfigConflicts
   codes map to the git section, toolTrustFailureCodes to the JVM section.
3. Never disable TLS verification, never unset HTTPS_PROXY, and do not retry
   organization policy denials (403/407) — report them instead.

## Failure classes and fixes

### "certificate verify failed" / "self-signed certificate in chain" / PKIX errors

The failing tool is not reading the pre-set CA configuration. In order:

- If the tool has a CA flag or env var, point it at ${AGENT_PROXY_CA_BUNDLE_PATH}
  (examples: --cacert, SSL_CERT_FILE, NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS, REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE,
  AWS_CA_BUNDLE, DENO_CERT, CARGO_HTTP_CAINFO, PIP_CERT, GIT_SSL_CAINFO,
  BUNDLE_SSL_CA_CERT, HEX_CACERTS_PATH, NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE).
- Tool config files override environment variables. If one of these sets its
  own CA or disables verification, point it at the bundle instead:
  pip.conf "cert", npm "cafile" (npm config get cafile), ~/.curlrc "cacert",
  .wgetrc "ca_certificate", conda "ssl_verify", git "http.sslCAInfo",
  gradle.properties / MAVEN_OPTS "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore".
- JVM tools (Maven, Gradle, plain Java): when a JDK is present, a truststore
  is built at ${AGENT_PROXY_STATE_DIR}/java-truststore.p12 (password "changeit") and
  injected via JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS — confirm javaTrustStorePath is set in the
  status output before pointing a build at it (toolTrustFailureCodes explains
  why it is missing). If the image or the build sets its own trustStore, that
  one wins — import the proxy CA into it with
  keytool -importcert -noprompt -alias ccr-agent-proxy -file ${AGENT_PROXY_STATE_DIR}/agent-proxy-ca.crt -keystore <their store>
  or point the build at the ready-made one. Bazel reads the managed block in
  /etc/bazel.bazelrc rather than JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS.

### "405 Method Not Allowed" from the proxy

The tool sent a plain-HTTP (non-CONNECT) request: usually axios older than
1.16.1 (upgrade it) or a tool configured with HTTP_PROXY (unset HTTP_PROXY for
that tool — only HTTPS_PROXY is supported).

### 403 / 407 from the proxy

The destination host is not allowed by your organization's egress policy for
this session. Do not retry or route around it — report the blocked host.
Note: curl hides response bodies on failed CONNECTs; the status endpoint
records the reason.

### Tool ignores the proxy entirely (timeouts with no proxy error)

Some clients do not read HTTPS_PROXY: Node's built-in fetch (run that command
with NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 on Node >= 22.21), aiohttp (pass trust_env=True),
Ruby bundler (reads only HTTP_PROXY, which this proxy does not serve),
hand-rolled Go dialers. Prefer the tool's own proxy option where one exists.

### git

SSH-form GitHub remotes (git@github.com:...) are rewritten to HTTPS
automatically unless this session has its own SSH setup or supplies its own
GIT_CONFIG_* (see gitSshRewrite in the status output). A gitconfig that sets
http.proxy / http.<url>.proxy (even empty), its own http.sslCAInfo, or an
https-to-ssh insteadOf makes git bypass the proxy or fail verification — the
status output's gitConfigConflicts codes name which of these were detected;
adjust those keys for this session if git times out.

### docker build / docker run

Processes inside containers cannot reach 127.0.0.1:${AGENT_PROXY_PORT} and do not trust
the CA. Workarounds: run builds with --network host, copy ${AGENT_PROXY_CA_BUNDLE_PATH}
into the build context and install it in an early layer, and pass proxy/CA
settings explicitly to the build.

### Not supported through the proxy (report, do not work around)

gRPC / HTTP/2-only APIs, WebSocket upgrades, client-mTLS, certificate-pinned
clients (e.g. Snowflake, ngrok), non-443 HTTPS ports, raw-TCP databases.

If a tool still cannot work through the proxy, report it to your
administrator or Anthropic support so the policy or tooling can be fixed.
