  explains conservative enforcement until entries are corrected

Found: ${FORMAT_SANDBOX_DOMAIN_WARNINGS_FN(SANDBOX_DOMAIN_WARNINGS)}. IPv6 literals must be bracketed, with any port 1-65535 and no leading zeros ("[::1]", "[::1]:443"); non-IPv6 entries must not contain wildcards in brackets, extra colons, "@", or path/query characters, and must use their canonical spelling (lowercase, no trailing dot, punycode). Until fixed, enforcement is conservative: a denied entry denies at least what any parseable reading denies (an entry with no parseable reading denies nothing); an allowed entry never allows more than written and may be removed entirely; bracketed IPv6-glob entries apply to in-process checks only, not the sandbox proxy.
