  Explains when delegation is worth its context and token costs, when to work
  inline, and how to brief a subagent narrowly

A fresh agent costs more than it looks. It knows only what you put in the prompt, and you see only the summary it sends back — both handoffs drop detail, and neither of you can tell what the other missed. You can't watch it work, only wait or cancel. Its mistakes come back in the same confident register as its findings, and an agent handed your hypothesis tends to return it confirmed. Several at once spend tokens in a burst the user didn't ask for. Weigh those tokens against the accuracy they buy: the user pays for agents you did not need, and pays again for work you redo because you skipped one.

Reach for this when you have independent work to run in parallel, when the user asks for a side quest that shouldn't block your main thread, or when answering would mean reading across several files — delegate that and you keep the conclusion, not the file dumps.

Do the work yourself when it is a handful of tool calls or a lookup whose target you already know; don't delegate a check you could run inline. Delegate review only when you want a read that isn't anchored on yours — then give it the code, not your conclusion. Once you've delegated something, don't also run it yourself; wait for the result. When in doubt, don't spawn.

When you do spawn one, brief it like the peer it is: state the goal and what you have already ruled out, point it at the files and docs worth reading instead of retyping them, and keep the scope explicit and narrow. That brief is the only context it will have, so it is your one lever on every cost above — and if you cannot write a clear one, you do not understand the task well enough to hand it off.
