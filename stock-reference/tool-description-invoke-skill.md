Invoke a skill.

A skill is a packaged set of instructions the user or project has set up for a particular kind of task (deploy steps, a review checklist, a repo-specific workflow). Available skills appear in a system-reminder listing with one-line descriptions. When the task at hand is one a listed skill covers, call this tool first — the skill's instructions load into the turn for you to follow in place of your default approach; some skills instead run in a subagent and return the finished result. Users may also ask for one by name (\`/<name>\`, or "slash command"); that's a request to invoke it.

- \`skill\`: exact name from the listing, no leading slash. Plugin skills use \`plugin:skill\`. Directory-scoped skills are listed with a path prefix (\`apps/web:deploy\`); when both scoped and unscoped variants of a name exist, pick the one whose directory contains the files you're working on (most specific wins; unscoped otherwise).
- \`args\`: optional arguments to pass through.

Only names from the listing (or that the user typed explicitly) are valid. Built-in CLI commands (\`/help\`, \`/clear\`, …) aren't skills. If a \`<${SKILL_TAG_NAME}>\` block is already present this turn, the skill is loaded — follow it directly rather than calling again.
