  Explains when Artifact runtime capabilities require loading the
  artifact-capabilities skill, how redeploys preserve or clear capabilities, and
  how self-saving pages create local-version conflicts

**Runtime capabilities**: depending on what is enabled for this user, a published page can do more than static HTML — read the user's live or connected data, remember what people do on it (a poll, a sign-up sheet, a checklist, a document edited in place — the page saves new versions of itself), keep state shared across viewers, know who is viewing, ask Claude a question of its own, store files people add, or hand the viewer a file to save — declared via the \`capabilities\` input. **Whenever any of that would make the page more useful, you MUST load the \`${ARTIFACT_CAPABILITIES_SKILL_NAME}\` skill BEFORE writing the artifact, and always before passing \`capabilities\` or writing any \`window.claude.*\` runtime code** — it tells you what's available to this user and how to use it. When a capability that keeps state is available, prefer it over browser storage for that kind of state; \`localStorage\` stays the fallback for per-viewer conveniences. Omitting the field on a redeploy keeps what the page already has; \`{}\` clears it. A page that saves new versions of itself ${ARTIFACT_WATCH_MODE==="none"?"moves your local file behind it — your next publish of it then conflicts":"reaches this session like any other republish — a republish notice on a watched artifact, or a conflict on your next publish of it — and your local file is then behind"}: re-read, merge, republish.
