  Schema description for the cancelled UUID list returned when an interrupt
  request cancels queued commands
ccVersion: 2.1.219

Present only when the request set cancel_queued:true — uuids of main-thread commands cancelled by this interrupt: every survivor that would otherwise have appeared under `still_queued`, including any uuid that was mid-fold at the interrupt instant (this request also aborts, so the fold never delivers it). Each listed uuid has been removed (queue-resident) or marked cancel-pending (the first-command prewait window, closed by the drain loop's backstop) and emits a terminal 'cancelled' lifecycle synchronously at the first such interrupt (a repeat interrupt over the same parked batch re-lists the uuid idempotently without re-emitting); none will run. Same coverage caveats as `still_queued` (uuid-stamped main-thread only; internally-enqueued uuids may appear). Advertised by the `interrupt_cancel_queued_v1` capability.
