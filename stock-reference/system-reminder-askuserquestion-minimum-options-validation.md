  Explains that a rejected single-option question was not shown and instructs
  the agent to proceed without retrying or inventing another option
ccVersion: 2.1.216
-->
This call included a question with fewer than 2 options, so it was rejected and the person never saw it. A question with a single option has no decision in it. Do not retry this call and do not invent a filler second option. Instead, state the one path you were going to offer as the approach you are taking, then continue with the task. If this call also contained questions with 2 to 4 options (each with distinct labels), you may re-ask those questions alone in a new call. Ask a question only when the person has at least two genuinely distinct choices.
