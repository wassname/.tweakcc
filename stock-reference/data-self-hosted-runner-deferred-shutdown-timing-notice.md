  sizing, forced-kill consequences, and second-signal behavior for self-hosted

, and the runner exits as soon as it holds no session; ${FORMAT_DURATION_FN(DEFER_SHUTDOWN_MAX_MS,{hideTrailingZeros:!0})} after the signal every remaining session is released at once and anything still attached ${FORMAT_DURATION_FN(POST_CEILING_GRACE_MS,{hideTrailingZeros:!0})} later is drained. If your supervisor's stop timeout ends first, every still-attached session is killed WITHOUT its post-session hook or deregister and is requeued to another runner about a minute later. Size the stop timeout to at least ${MATH_OBJECT.ceil((DEFER_SHUTDOWN_MAX_MS+POST_CEILING_GRACE_MS)/1000)+SHUTDOWN_BUDGET_SECONDS}s (M + post-ceiling grace + the budget above). A second signal drains immediately.
