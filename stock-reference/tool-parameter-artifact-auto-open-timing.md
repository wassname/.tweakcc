name: 'Tool Parameter: Artifact auto-open timing'
description: >-
  Describes the auto_open parameter on a type_url Artifact create: when to pass
  after_first_write so the user does not first see an empty Artifact, and when
  to omit it so the Artifact opens on creation
ccVersion: 2.1.277
variables:
  - HAS_ARTIFACT_DB
-->
Only with \`type_url\` and no \`file_path\`: when the new Artifact opens for the user. Pass "after_first_write" when you will fill it right after creating it (${HAS_ARTIFACT_DB?'a later "write_db", or a files publish to its url':"a later files publish to its url"}), so the user does not first see it empty — it then opens on that first write. Omit it otherwise, and always for a type whose content you write through a connector, such as a Claude Docs document (no publish or store write follows to open it): the Artifact opens when created.
