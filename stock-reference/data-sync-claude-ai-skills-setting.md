  Describes how the syncClaudeAiSkills setting disables account-synced skill
  downloads, availability, and cleanup across user, managed, workspace, and
  invocation scopes
ccVersion: 2.1.234
-->
Set to false to turn off syncing of the skills you have enabled on claude.ai. In your user settings (or managed settings): nothing more is downloaded, previously synced skills (~/.claude/skills/synced) can no longer be run, are hidden from every session started afterwards, and are moved to ~/.claude/skills/.trash at the next launch (deleted after cleanupPeriodDays; re-downloaded, not restored, if you re-enable). In .claude/settings.local.json or --settings: downloads stop and synced skills are blocked and hidden for sessions in that workspace or invocation only (nothing is moved). Not read from project settings (.claude/settings.json). Only false is honored — the feature is enabled server-side for your account, so setting true does not turn it on early. While it is on, synced skills are available in every session, re-synced every 10 minutes, and removed when you disable them on claude.ai. Only applies when signed in with your Claude account.
