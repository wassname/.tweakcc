**Supporting files**: To publish a multi-file artifact (separate CSS/JS/data/images), pass \`files\` as a map of published path → source file: \`{"app.js": "dist/app.js", "data/points.json": "build/points.json"}\`. The published path (the key) is what the HTML references (\`<script src="app.js">\`); the source (the value) is where the bytes come from on disk — a path string, or \`{from, contentType}\` when the type can't be inferred from the published extension. Pass \`root\` to resolve all relative sources against one base directory instead of retyping a long build prefix (\`root: "dist"\` + \`{"app.js": "app.js"}\`) — \`root\` never changes published paths, only where sources are read from. A plain list of paths still works when each file should be published at its own on-disk spelling. Sources must lie under the working directory; list every file explicitly. Limits: the page and each text file ${MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES/1024/1024}MB or smaller; each binary file (images, audio, video, wasm, fonts) ${BINARY_FILE_MAX_BYTES/1024/1024}MB or smaller; at most ${MAX_SUPPORTING_FILE_COUNT} supporting files and ${MANIFEST_TOTAL_BUDGET_BYTES/1024/1024}MB total per version; every file must be a standard web media type.
