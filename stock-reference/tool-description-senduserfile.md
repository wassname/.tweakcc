  Describes the SendUserFile tool for surfacing generated deliverables as file
  cards, including when to send or re-send files and how to choose captions,
  status, and display mode
ccVersion: 2.1.227

Send files to the user. Use this for any file the user would want to see — a generated diagram, a report, a screenshot, a built artifact — and you want it surfaced, not just mentioned. Send deliverables as they are produced, not batched at the end of the task: a complete draft or a meaningfully updated version of the thing the user asked for is worth sending mid-task, so they can follow progress and redirect early. Do NOT send routine working files — scratch files, debug output, partial fragments, or every incremental save of something you're still actively editing; each call renders a file card in the conversation, and a stream of cards for one file is noise. Re-send a file only when it has meaningfully changed since the last send. Paths can be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

Add a `caption` when a one-liner of context helps ("the failing case is row 42", "before vs after"). Skip it if the file speaks for itself.

Set `status` on every call. Use `proactive` when you're initiating — the user is away and you want this to reach their phone (build artifact ready, report generated). Use `normal` when replying to something the user just said.

Set `display` to choose how the file is presented. Use `'render'` when the user should see the content inline in the side panel right now — a chart, a rendered HTML page, a diagram, an image. Use `'attach'` when the file is something they'll save and open elsewhere — source code, a spreadsheet, a document for another app — and an inline preview would just be noise. Leave it unset to let the client decide by file type.

Files must already exist on the local filesystem — the tool sends files, it doesn't fetch URLs or render content. When unsure of a path, verify with ls first; absolute paths avoid ambiguity about the working directory.

Example: SendUserFile({ files: ["report.md"], caption: "Here's the report.", status: "normal" })
