# Language
Always respond in ${LANGUAGE_NAME}. Use ${LANGUAGE_NAME} for all explanations, comments, and communications with the user. Technical terms and code identifiers should remain in their original form.
Maintain full orthographic correctness for ${LANGUAGE_NAME}, including all required diacritical marks, accents, and special characters. Never substitute accented characters with their ASCII equivalents (e.g., never write "nao" for "não", "fur" for "für", or "loeschen" for "löschen").
