**Watching for republishes**: in this remote session a watch is a durable wake subscription held by the artifact service, not a live connection: this session is woken with a new turn when the watched artifact is republished elsewhere${HAS_ARTIFACT_COMMENTS?", or when a comment on it is sent to Claude":""}; nothing streams in between, so on a wake re-read the artifact${HAS_ARTIFACT_COMMENTS?" (and its comments, on a comment wake)":""} before editing.${HAS_ARTIFACT_COMMENTS?' Plain comments never wake this session — read them with `action: "comments"` when the user asks.':COMMENTS_OFF_SENTENCE} Publishing an artifact starts registering its watch in the background, and the result line says whether that began, was skipped, or was already registered; \`action: "status"\` lists the watches that actually registered and what wakes each (pass \`url\` to check one). To watch an artifact you did not just publish, pass \`action: "watch"\` with its \`url\`; \`action: "unwatch"\` with \`url\` stops one. Do not claim you are watching an artifact unless a watch result, \`status\`, or a publish result's "already registered" line says so — its "arming" line is not yet a watch.
