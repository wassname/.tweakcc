**Preview**: `action: "preview"` with a `file_path` renders that one page file locally the way publish wraps it, in light and dark themes at desktop and phone widths, and returns the screenshots with a mechanical checklist of layout and load problems, so you can see the page and fix what they show before publishing. It uploads nothing, needs no artifact URL, and runs without the artifact runtime, so capabilities are unavailable there and that code does not run — after publishing, exercise the capability code you wrote (read the stored data back, for example).
