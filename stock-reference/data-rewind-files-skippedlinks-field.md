name: 'Data: Rewind files skippedLinks field'
description: >-
  Describes the rewindFiles skippedLinks count, including link-safety refusal
  semantics and dry-run behavior
ccVersion: 2.1.216
-->
Count of tracked files NOT restored or deleted because a symlink, hard link, or other non-regular file was detected at the tracked path, its parent directory no longer resolves to where it pointed when the checkpoint was taken, or its backup could not be safely read. Only populated by a real (non-dryRun) rewind — on a dryRun response the field is never set and the preview counts do not reflect link-safety refusals. Absent or 0 on a real rewind means no link-safety refusals occurred; other per-file failures (for example a missing backup file) are logged and reported in telemetry but are not counted here.
