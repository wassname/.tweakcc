  only project content

This type keeps a new Artifact's content in the Artifact's own files under \`project/\`${ARTIFACT_CONTENT_STORAGE_ACCESS_CONFIG.storeDescribed?`, never in its store${ARTIFACT_CONTENT_STORAGE_ACCESS_CONFIG.storeCall===null?"":` (no ${ARTIFACT_CONTENT_STORAGE_ACCESS_CONFIG.storeCall} for its content)`}`:""}. The files: \`${ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG.index}\`, the index, a JSON object with ${ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG.indexKeys}, plus ${ARTIFACT_CREATED_ON_FILES_MARKER}; and ${ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG.files}.${ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG.uploads}${FORMAT_ARTIFACT_TYPE_STORE_OVERRIDE_NOTE_FN(ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG,ARTIFACT_CONTENT_STORAGE_ACCESS_CONFIG.storeDescribed)} ${FORMAT_ARTIFACT_FIRST_PUBLISH_INSTRUCTIONS_FN(ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG,ARTIFACT_URL)} Later changes: ${ARTIFACT_CONTENT_STORAGE_ACCESS_CONFIG.pinned?`${FORMAT_PINNED_FILE_READ_GUIDANCE_FN(ARTIFACT_CONTENT_STORAGE_ACCESS_CONFIG.read)} Publish only the changed files the same way (\`file_path\`: one changed file's absolute path, \`files\`: the other changed ones); send the index only when you ${ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG.indexEdits}, keeping every other key and its \`createdOnFiles\` object as you last wrote or read it. ${PUBLISH_REFUSAL_FOLLOW_NOTE}`:`read each file you will change (${ARTIFACT_CONTENT_STORAGE_ACCESS_CONFIG.read}) and publish only those the same way (\`file_path\`: one changed file's absolute path); send the index only when you ${ARTIFACT_TYPE_FILE_STORAGE_CONFIG.indexEdits}, keeping every other key and its \`createdOnFiles\` object as read.`} Never publish index.html, SKILL.md or anything under \`artifact-type/\`.
