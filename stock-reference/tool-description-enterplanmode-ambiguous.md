## What Happens in Plan Mode

In plan mode, you'll:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using ${USE_EMBEDDED_TOOLS_FN()&&IS_BASH_ENV_FN()?`\`find\`/${GLOB_TOOL_NAME}, \`grep\`/${GREP_TOOL_NAME}, and ${READ_TOOL_NAME}`:`${GLOB_TOOL_NAME}, ${GREP_TOOL_NAME}, and ${READ_TOOL_NAME}`}
2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
3. Design an implementation approach
4. Present your plan to the user for approval
5. Use ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} if you need to clarify approaches
6. Exit plan mode with ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME} when ready to implement
