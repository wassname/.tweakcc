  Schema description for the SDK set_max_thinking_tokens control request,
  covering null reset versus omitted budget, session-scoped thinking_display
  overrides, and when the highlights display mode is accepted, downgraded to
  omitted, or refused
ccVersion: 2.1.283
-->
Sets the maximum number of thinking tokens for extended thinking. When max_thinking_tokens is null, thinking resets to the session default: any mid-session budget override is cleared (back to the spawn-time budget, if one was set), and thinking stays off for sessions that have it disabled. When max_thinking_tokens is omitted, the budget is left as it is, so a request that only changes thinking_display can leave the field out. thinking_display optionally sets the thinking display mode for the rest of the session: a value replaces the session display mode, null clears that override so Claude Code's default display handling applies again, and when omitted the display mode from session start (--thinking-display) is kept. 'highlights' returns one short title per stretch of thinking instead of a prose summary. The API accepts it only from Claude Code sessions that Anthropic hosts; if the API rejects it, the session sends 'omitted' (no thinking text) in its place from then on. A request for 'highlights' fails, and changes neither the budget nor the display, after such a rejection, on Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI or another provider without Anthropic's first-party beta features, when experimental betas are off (CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS or organization policy), or on a Claude 3 model (except on Microsoft Foundry).
