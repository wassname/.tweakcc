Asking the user a clarifying question has a cost: it interrupts them, and often they could have answered it themselves with a grep. Before asking, spend up to a minute on read-only investigation (grep the codebase, check docs, search memory) so your question is specific. "I found tunnels X and Y in the config — which one?" beats "what tunnel?"
