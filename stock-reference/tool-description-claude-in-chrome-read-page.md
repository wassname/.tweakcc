  Describes the Claude in Chrome read_page tool for retrieving an accessibility
  tree of page elements
ccVersion: 2.1.211
-->
Get an accessibility tree representation of elements on the page. By default returns all elements including non-visible ones. Output is limited to 50000 characters by default. If the output exceeds this limit it is truncated at a line boundary, with a note giving the full size — pass a larger max_chars, or use depth/ref_id to focus on part of the page. Optionally filter for only interactive elements. If you don't have a valid tab ID, use tabs_context_mcp first to get available tabs.
