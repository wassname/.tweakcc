 'preview' renders a local page file before you publish it — pass \`file_path\` (one .html file; files published beside it are not loaded), optionally \`widths\` (viewport widths in px, default 1280 and 390) and \`themes\` ('light', 'dark', default both) — and returns a screenshot per width and theme (each shows at most the top ${MAX_PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT_HEIGHT_PX} px of the page) plus a checklist of layout and load problems (horizontal overflow, clipped content, theme-only color variables, blocked or local-only loads, diagram and console errors). Nothing is uploaded.
