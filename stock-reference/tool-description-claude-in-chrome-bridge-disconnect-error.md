  Error message shown when a Claude in Chrome tool call fails because the Chrome
  extension disconnects mid-operation
ccVersion: 2.1.173
variables:
  - CHROME_TOOL_NAME
-->
The "${CHROME_TOOL_NAME}" tool call failed because the Chrome extension disconnected mid-operation. This is usually transient (Chrome service worker restart, tab closed, network blip) and the extension often reconnects automatically. Retry the same tool call in a few seconds. If it keeps failing, ask the user to switch to Chrome (which wakes the extension) or check that the extension is still logged in.
