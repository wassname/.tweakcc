  Schema description for the MCP server status error_code field, naming the
  host-fixable failure causes — a rejected claude.ai connector login, a rejected
  first-party Anthropic credential, and a project-scoped server awaiting
  approval — and noting that it is absent for every other failure and that new
  values are additive
ccVersion: 2.1.275

@internal Why a 'failed' row failed, for the causes a host can fix: CLAUDEAI_BEARER_REJECTED (a claude.ai connector rejected the claude.ai login — sign in again), FIRST_PARTY_AUTH_REJECTED (a first-party Anthropic server rejected its credential — the claude.ai login, or for the Claude Design server its /design-login authorization; the row's error names which sign-in fixes it), APPROVAL_REQUIRED (a project-scoped server awaiting the user's approval). Absent for every other failure; new values are additive.
