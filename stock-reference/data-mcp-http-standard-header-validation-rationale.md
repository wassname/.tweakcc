  Explains the modern MCP HTTP validation ladder's Mcp-Method and Mcp-Name
  header checks and their observed pre-dispatch precedence

SEP-2243 standard `Mcp-Method` / `Mcp-Name` headers — presence, sentinel decoding, and `Mcp-Name` ↔ body cross-check — are validated by the HTTP entry on a modern-classified request after the supported-revision gate and before dispatch. The classifier’s own header-mismatch cells (protocol-version, `Mcp-Method` mismatch) stay on the edge `era-classification` rung; this rung carries the entry-layer presence/`Mcp-Name` half. Evaluated before the capability gate, the factory call, and the `Mcp-Param-*` rung so a request that fails several rungs is answered by the standard-header rung first. The documented order (after method-registry 5 and request-params 6) is NOT the observed precedence: serveModern evaluates this rung immediately after the supported-revision gate, so a request that also fails a dispatch rung is answered here before the dispatch rungs (5–6) are consulted.
