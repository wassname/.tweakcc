name: 'Tool Description: Bash (sandbox — local port binding EPERM, no override)'
description: >-
  Explains that an EPERM failure binding or listening on a local port is caused
  by the sandbox, and directs the user to enable allowLocalBinding themselves,
  for sessions where unsandboxed retries are not available
ccVersion: 2.1.281
variables:
  - SANDBOX_EXCLUDE_COMMAND_SUFFIX
-->
If a command fails to bind or listen on a local port with "Operation not permitted" (EPERM), local port binding is off in this sandbox. Tell the user they can allow it with \`sandbox.network.allowLocalBinding: true\` in their settings (it applies without a restart)${SANDBOX_EXCLUDE_COMMAND_SUFFIX}; changing sandbox settings is their decision, not yours.
