  Schema description for the turn_handoff memory_context member carrying the
  claude.ai memory snapshot the client showed its model, how the worker writes
  it as a cowork_memory_context attachment line ahead of the handed-over
  messages, and when a malformed or uuid-colliding member is ignored
ccVersion: 2.1.275
-->
@internal The snapshot of the user's claude.ai memory that the client showed its model with the turn's user message. Used only on a request that names calls to run: the worker writes it ahead of the first of messages, with uuid as the line's uuid, as a cowork_memory_context attachment line like those it writes for snapshots it fetches itself, and then adds no copy of that version. version and content are both strings for a snapshot, both null to withdraw an earlier one. The member is never a reason to refuse the request: one that is malformed, that has a version without content or the reverse, or whose uuid is also that of one of messages, of relay_marker or of a line the session's transcript holds, is ignored, and the turn runs without the line.
