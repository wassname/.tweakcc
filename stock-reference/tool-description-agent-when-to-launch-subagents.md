Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types are listed in <system-reminder> messages in the conversation.${AGENT_TYPES_BLOCK}

${CAN_FORK_CONTEXT?`When using the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool, specify a subagent_type to select an agent: \`"fork"\` forks yourself (the fork inherits your full conversation context and always runs on your model — a \`model\` override is ignored); any other type — or omitting it — starts a fresh agent (general-purpose by default).`:`When using the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool, specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use. If omitted, the general-purpose agent is used.`}
