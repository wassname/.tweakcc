**External resources — CDN allowlist (CSP-enforced)**: external scripts load ONLY from https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com (preferred), https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/, https://unpkg.com, https://cdn.tailwindcss.com (Tailwind's play-CDN script) and https://code.jquery.com; external stylesheets ONLY from https://fonts.googleapis.com, with the font files they pull from https://fonts.gstatic.com (give every face a real fallback stack). Everything else is blocked, with no visible error: every other host (esm.sh included) and, even on those CDNs, anything but a script — stylesheets, images, media, fetch/XHR/WebSocket, a library's runtime fetches. So inline all other CSS and JS and embed assets as data: URIs.
