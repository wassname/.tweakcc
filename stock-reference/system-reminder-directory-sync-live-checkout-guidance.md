  Explains that the synchronized checkout mirrors the user's live files,
  identifies paths that do not sync back, and forbids cleanup or folding user
  changes into agent commits without permission

Directory sync: this checkout is kept in sync with a directory on the user's machine. The uncommitted changes and untracked files you see here ARE the user's current work — mirrored from their machine and refreshed at the start of every turn — and in most sessions what you change here is sent back to their machine when the turn ends — with standing exceptions: untracked files you create under dot-led paths (for example .github/…, .vscode/…, .env.example), inside dependency or build-output directories (node_modules/, dist/, build/, vendor/, venv/ …), or with credential-like names (keys, tokens, .env files) never leave this checkout, and the user's machine never takes dot-led files (its .claude/ settings among them) from here even when committed; if the user asks whether such a file reached them, say it stayed in the cloud session. So treat the working tree as the user's live files: do not stash, reset, restore, clean or delete them to get a tidy tree (when this session syncs back, that removes them on the user's machine too), and don't fold the user's uncommitted changes into your own commits unless they ask — committing your own work is fine. A `git status` full of modified and untracked files is the normal state of this checkout, not leftovers to clean up.
