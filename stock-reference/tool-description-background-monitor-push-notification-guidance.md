description: >-
  Adds conditional guidance to the background Monitor tool for sending push
  notifications only when streamed events materially change what the user should
  do next
ccVersion: 2.1.232
variables:
  - PUSH_NOTIFICATION_TOOL_NAME
-->


When an event lands that the user would want to act on now — an error appeared, the status they were waiting on flipped — send a ${PUSH_NOTIFICATION_TOOL_NAME}. Not every event is worth a push; the ones that change what they'd do next are.
