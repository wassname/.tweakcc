  Tool description for reporting verified code-review findings as a typed list
  for host UI rendering
ccVersion: 2.1.196
-->
Report code-review findings as a typed list so the host UI can render them. Use this only when the active code-review instructions tell you to report findings with this tool; otherwise follow whatever output format those instructions specify. When reporting a review's results, call it once with the verified findings ranked most-severe first (empty array if nothing survived verification) and do not also print the findings as text. When re-reporting after applying fixes (only if the apply instructions ask for it), set `outcome` on each finding to what actually happened.
