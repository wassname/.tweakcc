  Requires Claude to disclose how much file content was read before summarizing

- Before producing ANY summary or analysis, you MUST explicitly describe what portion of the content you have read. ***If you did not read the entire content, you MUST explicitly state this.***
- If after a few attempts you cannot read the file (file not found, lines too long for Read's offset/limit, no shell access), STOP retrying. Summarize what you were able to read, explicitly state which portion you could not read and why, and proceed.
