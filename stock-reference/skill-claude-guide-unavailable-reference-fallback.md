## Reference Files Unavailable

This skill's reference files could not be written to disk for this session, so the \`{lang}/…\`, \`shared/…\`, and \`curl/…\` files cited above cannot be Read. Do not guess their contents — WebFetch the matching URL from \`shared/live-sources.md\`, included below, whenever the Reading Guide points at one of those files. If a cited \`shared/…\` file has no matching URL below (skill-authored guides such as \`shared/prompt-audit.md\`, \`shared/agent-design.md\`, \`shared/platform-availability.md\`), state that the reference is unavailable this session and proceed best-effort from this document.
