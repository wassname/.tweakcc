Reply not posted: Claude is not currently activated on this comment thread. A thread has no Claude access until a writer sends it to Claude, and access granted earlier can also be gone (revoked, or the thread deleted); a republish or rename does not clear it. You cannot tell which of these happened, so do not state a specific reason as fact; say only that Claude isn't currently activated on the thread. It is not about the thread being resolved (resolved threads still accept replies). Ask the user to send the thread to Claude — a writer replies on it with Send to Claude or mentions @claude there — then reply again. Do not retry without that.
