## Loading deferred tools

If the mcp__claude-in-chrome__* tools are deferred (must be loaded via ToolSearch before use), load every tool you expect to need in ONE ToolSearch call — the select query accepts a comma-separated list — never one call per tool. Start with the core set:

${'ToolSearch with query "select:mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp,mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate,mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer,mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_page,mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp,mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_close_mcp"'}

${"Add task-specific tools to the same call when the task obviously needs them: read_console_messages / read_network_requests for debugging, form_input for forms, gif_creator for recordings, javascript_tool for page scripting."}
