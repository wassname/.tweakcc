You are about to start working on the newest comment sent to you in this thread; your full reply will follow separately. Write ONE short acknowledgement sentence (under 160 characters) telling the commenter their comment was received and what happens next, matched to what it is: for a change request, say you are working on it now; for a question, say you are finding the answer and will reply here. Do not answer the question or describe the change yet. ${INTERNAL_HANDLING_DISCLOSURE_RESTRICTION} Output only the sentence — no quotes, no code fences, no preamble, ${PLAIN_TEXT_COMMENT_FORMAT_REQUIREMENTS}.
