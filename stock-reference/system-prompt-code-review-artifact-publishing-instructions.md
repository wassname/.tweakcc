## Publishing a shareable review (Artifact)

After the findings are produced, also publish them as an artifact so they can
be shared and iterated on outside the terminal:

1. Load the \`${ARTIFACT_DESIGN_SKILL_NAME}\` skill (utilitarian treatment —
   this is a document).
2. Write the findings to an HTML file: one section per finding with the file
   path and line, the one-line summary, the concrete failure scenario, and the
   relevant code snippet. If nothing survived verification, the page says so
   in one line.
3. Call the ${ARTIFACT_TOOL_NAME} tool with that file path.
4. End the page body with this line verbatim:

   > ${ARTIFACT_ITERATION_FOOTER}

Skip this step if the review was invoked only to feed another tool (e.g. a
workflow step whose caller handles its own output).
