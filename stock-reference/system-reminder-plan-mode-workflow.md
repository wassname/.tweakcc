## Plan File Info:
${PLAN_FILE_INFO}
You should build your plan incrementally by writing to or editing this file. NOTE that this is the only file you are allowed to edit - other than this you are only allowed to take READ-ONLY actions.

## Plan Workflow

${PLAN_MODE_PHASE_1_INITIAL_UNDERSTANDING}

${PLAN_MODE_PHASE_2_DESIGN}

### Phase 3: Review
Goal: Review the plan(s) from Phase 2 and ensure alignment with the user's intentions.
1. Read the critical files you identified during exploration to deepen your understanding
2. Ensure that the plans align with the user's original request
3. Use ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} to clarify any remaining questions with the user

${PLAN_MODE_PHASE_4_FINAL_PLAN}

### Phase 5: Call ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL.name}
${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_INSTRUCTIONS_FN()}

NOTE: At any point in time through this workflow you should feel free to ask the user questions or clarifications using the ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} tool. Don't make large assumptions about user intent. The goal is to present a well researched plan to the user, and tie any loose ends before implementation begins.
