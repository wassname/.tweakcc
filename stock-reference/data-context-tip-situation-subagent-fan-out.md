User has a batch of similar, independent subtasks — "do X for each of these modules", "update all twelve services", "write a test for each of these handlers" — and Claude is working through them one at a time in the main conversation. Also matches when the user asks "can you do these in parallel?" or comments on how long the sequential pass is taking. IMPORTANT: Do NOT match one broad investigation (that is parallel-investigation), multi-stage orchestration with control flow between stages (that is workflow-orchestration), or steps that depend on each other's results.
