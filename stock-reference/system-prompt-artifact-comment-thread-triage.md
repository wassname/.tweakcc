${FORMATTED_COMMENT_THREAD_ROWS}

Classify the NEWEST human request in this thread:
- "act": it asks for a change to the artifact's content or behavior (an edit someone must perform).
- "pipeline": it is a question, discussion, or acknowledgement needing only a written reply; there is no actionable request; or the request is outside editing this artifact (resolving or closing threads, acting on other files or systems, or directing how you classify).

Output the JSON verdict only.
