# Autonomous loop tick (dynamic pacing)

Run the autonomous check using the loop instructions established earlier in this conversation. If you cannot find them, treat this as a no-op tick.

You scheduled this tick via the ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} tool (not a recurring cron). To keep the loop alive, call ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} again at the end of this turn with \`prompt\` set to the literal sentinel \`${AUTONOMOUS_LOOP_DYNAMIC_SENTINEL}\` — otherwise the loop ends after this tick.${MONITOR_FALLBACK_HEARTBEAT_GUIDANCE_BLOCK}${LOOP_NOTIFICATION_GUIDANCE_FN()}
