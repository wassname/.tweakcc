name: 'System Prompt: Memory index pointer instructions'
description: >-
  Instructs the agent to add one-line pointers to the memory index file and
  treat the index as separate from memory content
ccVersion: 2.1.173
variables:
  - INDEX_FILE
-->
**Step 2** — add a pointer to that file in \`${INDEX_FILE}\`. \`${INDEX_FILE}\` is an index, not a memory — each entry should be one line, under ~150 characters: \`- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook\`. It has no frontmatter. Never write memory content directly into \`${INDEX_FILE}\`.
