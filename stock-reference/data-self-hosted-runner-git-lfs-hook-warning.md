  Runner warning that git-lfs's pre-push hook never runs inside lifecycle hooks,
  so a post-session git push sends LFS pointers without their objects, and how
  to push the objects or point core.hooksPath instead
ccVersion: 2.1.280
variables:
  - RUNNER_GIT_CONFIG_SCAN
  - IS_RUNNER_ROOT
-->
[runner:warn] git-lfs is set up in the ${RUNNER_GIT_CONFIG_SCAN.lfsFilterScopes.join(" and ")} git config and this runner has a post-session hook. Git run inside the runner's lifecycle hooks runs no repository or global git hooks, so git-lfs's pre-push hook does not run there and a plain "git push" from the post-session hook sends LFS pointers WITHOUT their objects. The runner cannot see whether your hook already handles this: in it, run "git-lfs push <remote> <branch>" BEFORE "git push" (or "git-lfs push --all <remote> <branch>" after it), or point core.hooksPath, ${IS_RUNNER_ROOT?"as":"in the system git config or as"} a GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n/GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n pair in the runner's environment, at a root-owned directory that holds git-lfs's pre-push hook. The session's own git is unaffected.
