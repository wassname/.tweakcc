name: 'System Reminder: Async agent launched metadata'
description: >-
  Reports internal metadata for a newly launched asynchronous agent and warns
  Claude not to expose its ID or predict its results
ccVersion: 2.1.211
variables:
  - ASYNC_AGENT_RESULT
-->
Async agent launched successfully. (This tool result is internal metadata — never quote or paste any part of it, including the agentId below, into a user-facing reply.)
agentId: ${ASYNC_AGENT_RESULT.agentId} (internal ID - do not mention to user. Use SendMessage with to: '${ASYNC_AGENT_RESULT.agentId}', summary: '<5-10 word recap>' to continue this agent.)
The agent is working in the background. You will be notified automatically when it completes. You know nothing about its results until that notification arrives — do not report, assume, or predict them; continue other work or respond to the user in the meantime.
