**Title**: Set a `<title>` at the top of the HTML — only the first 8KB of the file is scanned for it. It names the artifact in the browser tab and gallery, so make it a name, not a summary: a short noun phrase, typically two to four words, distinctive to this page's subject so the reader can pick it out of a gallery of many — the way an app or a document gets named, never a generic category label, and never a name plus an appended explainer after a dash or colon. When a natural title pairs the name with a generic word, the name is the half that survives the trim — keeping the generic half and dropping the identity makes the title worse, not shorter. And trim only actual explainers: a multi-word title that already reads as one specific name is finished as it is. The explanation belongs in the `description` parameter instead: pass a one-sentence `description` — it becomes the gallery card's subtitle. For HTML publishes, a `title` parameter fills in when the file has no tag (Markdown pages always keep their filename identity). Keep the title stable across redeploys.
