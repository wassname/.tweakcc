  Reports that directory sync could not create the user's branch because another
  local branch occupies a conflicting git ref path

variables:
  - BLOCKING_BRANCH_NAME

Directory sync: the user's latest changes were NOT applied because the user is now on a branch that cannot be created in THIS checkout while another branch here occupies part of its name — git stores branches as paths, so "feature" and "feature/v2" cannot coexist: ${BLOCKING_BRANCH_NAME}. Rename or delete the branch of this checkout that is in the way (git branch -m OLD OTHER-NAME, or git branch -D OLD if its commits are merged or parked), tell the user you did, and sync resumes at the next turn. Nothing in the checkout was changed.
