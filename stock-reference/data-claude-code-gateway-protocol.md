# Claude Code gateway protocol

This is the wire contract the Claude Code CLI uses to talk to this gateway:
sign-in, inference, managed settings, and telemetry. It's served from the
gateway itself so it always matches the version you're running.

> **Stability:** this protocol exists to give you a more stable target than
> proxying raw CLI traffic. Auth is standard OAuth 2.0, inference is the
> Messages API, and headers are the lowest common denominator across
> backends. We keep it backwards compatible within reason to support older
> clients, but not forever — expect changes, managed settings in particular,
> with notice.

A developer points Claude Code at your gateway's base URL via \`/login\` and
the client does the rest. All paths below are relative to that base URL, and
the client does not follow cross-origin redirects.

## Flow

1. Client fetches \`GET {base}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\`.
2. On first contact, client fingerprints your TLS certificate and asks the
   user to trust it.
3. Client runs the RFC 8628 device flow: \`POST device_authorization_endpoint\`
   -> user approves in a browser at \`verification_uri\` -> client polls
   \`token_endpoint\` until it gets a bearer token.
4. Client sends \`Authorization: Bearer <token>\` on every subsequent request.
5. Client uses fixed paths under \`{base}\` for inference (\`/v1/messages\`),
   policy (\`/managed/settings\`), model discovery (\`/v1/models\`), and
   telemetry (\`/v1/{metrics,logs,traces}\`).
6. Before the token expires, client silently calls \`token_endpoint\` with
   \`grant_type=refresh_token\`. If you didn't issue a refresh token, the user
   is sent back through the browser flow instead.

## Discovery — required

\`GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\` (unauthenticated)

RFC 8414 authorization server metadata. The client reads
\`device_authorization_endpoint\` and \`token_endpoint\` and ignores the rest;
both must be same-origin with \`{base}\`. \`authorization_endpoint\` is
intentionally absent.

    {
      "issuer": "https://gw.corp.example.com",
      "device_authorization_endpoint": "https://gw.corp.example.com/oauth/device_authorization",
      "token_endpoint": "https://gw.corp.example.com/oauth/token",
      "grant_types_supported": ["urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code", "refresh_token"]
    }

## Device authorization — required

\`POST {device_authorization_endpoint}\` (unauthenticated)

RFC 8628 §3.2. The client opens \`verification_uri_complete\` in the user's
browser and polls \`token_endpoint\` every \`interval\` seconds.

    {
      "device_code": "AbK9-s3n4C8H...",
      "user_code": "WDJB-MJHT",
      "verification_uri": "https://gw.corp.example.com/device",
      "verification_uri_complete": "https://gw.corp.example.com/device?user_code=WDJB-MJHT",
      "expires_in": 600,
      "interval": 5
    }

\`device_code\` should be >=256 bits, opaque, single-use. \`user_code\` should
use a base-20 charset (RFC 8628 §6.1).

## Verification page — required

\`GET/POST {verification_uri}\` (browser-facing; the client never calls this)

Accept the user code, authenticate the user against your IdP, and mark the
matching \`device_code\` approved so the next token poll succeeds. Apply a
per-IP rate limit (RFC 8628 §5.1) and don't auto-submit a pre-filled code
(§5.4).

## Token — required

\`POST {token_endpoint}\` (unauthenticated,
\`application/x-www-form-urlencoded\`)

**Device grant** (\`grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code\`):

| Status | Body | Client reaction |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | \`{"access_token","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in","refresh_token"?}\` | Login complete. \`refresh_token\` is optional; omit it and the client re-runs the device flow on expiry. |
| 400 | \`{"error":"authorization_pending"}\` | Keep polling. |
| 400/429 | \`{"error":"slow_down"}\` | Add 5s to the poll interval. |
| 400 | \`{"error":"access_denied"}\` | Stop. |
| 400 | \`{"error":"expired_token"}\` | Stop. |

**Refresh grant** (\`grant_type=refresh_token\`): return a fresh
\`{"access_token","token_type","expires_in","refresh_token"}\` on 200. Return
\`401 {"error":"invalid_grant"}\` to force re-login — this is your
deprovisioning hook.

## Messages — required

\`POST /v1/messages\` and \`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens\` (bearer)

The Anthropic Messages API (https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages),
unchanged. Proxy to your upstream and stream the response back. Enforce your
model allowlist here, returning \`400 invalid_request_error\` for a denied
model. Don't buffer SSE on the \`stream: true\` path. The client always sets
\`Content-Length\`, so you may reject chunked-without-CL (\`411\`) and cap body
size (\`413\`). The client doesn't assume server-side tools are available. The
client also sends \`x-app\` and \`x-stainless-*\` headers — pass them through or
drop them, but don't reject the request because of them.

## Managed settings — optional

\`GET /managed/settings\` (bearer)

The authenticated user's Claude Code \`managed-settings.json\`; see
https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings for the key reference. The client
polls about once an hour; support \`ETag\`/\`If-None-Match\` -> \`304\` to keep
that cheap. Return \`404\` for "no managed policy"; \`200 {}\` means "this user
has an empty policy" — they're not the same. **This is the endpoint most
likely to change.**

## Models — optional

\`GET /v1/models\` (bearer)

Anthropic models-list shape: \`{"data":[{"id","display_name"},...]}\`. Use
Anthropic-style IDs (\`claude-{family}-{major}-{minor}\`) — the client's
model-family logic keys on that shape. The client only calls this when
\`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY\` is set on the client, which you
can push via the \`env\` block in \`/managed/settings\`. Return \`404\` to fall
back to the client's built-in list.

## Telemetry — optional

\`POST /v1/metrics\`, \`/v1/logs\`, \`/v1/traces\` (bearer)

OTLP/HTTP (protobuf or JSON). When connected to a gateway the client sends
telemetry here and ignores \`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*\` env vars. Return \`200\`
whether you forward or discard — \`404\` makes the client's exporter log an
error on every flush.

## Errors

OAuth endpoints use \`{"error":"...","error_description":"..."}\`
(RFC 6749/8628). Bearer-authenticated endpoints use the Anthropic envelope so
the SDK surfaces the message to the user:

    {"type":"error","error":{"type":"authentication_error","message":"..."}}

| HTTP | error.type | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | \`invalid_request_error\` | Denied model, malformed body, policy violation |
| 401 | \`authentication_error\` | Missing/expired/invalid bearer; client prompts re-login |
| 403 | \`permission_error\` | Authenticated but not allowed |
| 413 | \`request_too_large\` | Body over your cap |
| 429 | \`rate_limit_error\` | Throttling; include \`Retry-After\` |
| 501 | \`not_supported\` | Endpoint not available on this backend |
| 529 | \`overloaded_error\` | Upstream at capacity; client backs off and retries |
| 5xx | \`api_error\` | Anything else |

## Bearer token

Your \`access_token\` is opaque to the client — it stores it, sends it, and
refreshes it before \`expires_in\`, but never inspects the payload. Encode the
user's identity and groups in the token (or in server-side state keyed by it)
so you can apply per-user RBAC at \`/v1/messages\` and per-group policy at
\`/managed/settings\`. The same token must work across every
bearer-authenticated endpoint.

## TLS

\`https://\` is required; \`http://\` is accepted only for loopback during
development. The client pins the SHA-256 fingerprint of your TLS leaf
certificate per-hostname after the user confirms it on first connect, and
re-prompts on mismatch — rotating your certificate costs every user one
confirmation prompt.

## Client guarantees

- OAuth endpoint paths come from your discovery document; the client never
  hard-codes \`/oauth/token\`.
- Fixed-path endpoints are resolved against \`{base}\`, never a redirect.
- Every request body carries \`Content-Length\`.
- The OTLP exporter is locked to \`{base}/v1/{signal}\` regardless of the
  user's environment.
- \`404\` from \`/v1/models\` or \`/managed/settings\` is a clean "not
  implemented", with no retry storm.

## Proxying to Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry

Proxying to \`api.anthropic.com\` is pass-through. Proxying to a cloud
provider's Claude endpoint needs translation:

- **Model IDs.** The client sends Anthropic-style IDs like
  \`claude-sonnet-4-5\`; translate to the upstream's form (Bedrock model ID or
  inference-profile ARN; Vertex \`@\`-versioned ID), or advertise
  upstream-native IDs from \`/v1/models\`.
- **\`anthropic-beta\`.** Bedrock rejects some betas in the *header*; move them
  into the request body as \`"anthropic_beta": [...]\`. Vertex and Foundry
  accept the header.
- **Streaming.** Bedrock's native stream is AWS binary event-stream, not SSE;
  decode and re-emit Anthropic-shaped \`text/event-stream\`. The provider SDKs
  handle this.
- **\`count_tokens\`.** Bedrock has no count-tokens API. Return
  \`501 not_supported\`; the client falls back to a Haiku \`max_tokens:1\` probe.
- **Headers.** Forward \`content-type\`, \`accept\`, \`accept-encoding\`,
  \`anthropic-version\`, \`anthropic-beta\`, \`user-agent\`, and \`x-stainless-*\`;
  strip the client's \`Authorization\` and apply the upstream's own
  credentials. On the response, strip hop-by-hop headers
  (\`content-encoding\`, \`content-length\`, \`transfer-encoding\`, \`connection\`).
- **Errors.** Upstream error messages can carry your cloud account
  IDs/ARNs/project IDs — log them for the operator, return a generic
  message, but keep \`error.type\` so the client's retry logic still works.
