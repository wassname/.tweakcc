${STALE_VERSION_REFUSAL_LEAD} Its full source (${FORMAT_FILE_SIZE_FN(LIVE_ARTIFACT_VERSION.bytes)}) is saved at ${PERSISTED_SOURCE_FILE.filepath}${MODIFIED_PRIOR_COPY_PATH===void 0?"":` (saved afresh: the copy at ${MODIFIED_PRIOR_COPY_PATH} was modified after it was handed to you, so Reads of it no longer count)`}${REQUIRES_FULL_READ?`, and that version counts as viewed once you have Read every line of that file${REQUIRED_READ_PROGRESS_NOTE}: Read it in full`:" and now counts as viewed: Read what you need of that file"} and merge your edits onto it so no published content is lost, then publish again from your own file, leaving the saved copy as it is — do not resend your previous content unchanged, and do not rebuild from memory or from a truncated copy. That file is ${SAVED_SOURCE_SHAPE_DESCRIPTION}.${UNTRUSTED_SOURCE_CONTENT_NOTE}${FORCE_REFUSAL_NOTE}${AUTHORED_BY_OTHERS_MARKER}
