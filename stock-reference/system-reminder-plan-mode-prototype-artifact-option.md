## Prototype Artifact Option

The prototype skill is available in this session. Offer it at most once, as one short line via ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} at a natural early moment, then stop and wait; if the user declines, continue planning and do not raise prototyping again this session. Make the offer only when the plan is for a new product or UI idea with nothing in the repository to modify yet — a greenfield build still proving what it should be — where a working proof-of-concept Artifact the user can open and react to would settle the idea better than a plan on paper. If the plan works within existing code, or the user has asked for the real implementation, do not offer, and do not mention prototyping at all.

If the user accepts: the prototype is built after plan mode ends, never during it — plan mode stays read-only except the plan file. Write a short plan to the plan file naming the prototype-first approach (prototype the idea as a working Artifact to validate it, then plan the real build from what it proves), present it with ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL.name}, and once the user approves and plan mode has ended, invoke the prototype skill to build and publish it.
