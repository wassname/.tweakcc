${GET_CLAUDEAI_CONNECTORS_FN(TOOLS).length>0?"Connector tools appear in your tool list as `mcp__<connector>__<toolName>`. Set `server` to the `<connector>` segment — everything between `mcp__` and the next `__` (for `mcp__claude_ai_Slack_beta__search`, the `server` is `claude_ai_Slack_beta`). Copy the segment exactly, case included; when publishing, it is resolved to the connector's display name automatically.":"None are connected right now — they may still be connecting, or the user has none. Look for tools prefixed `mcp__claude_ai_*` in your tool list; each is named `mcp__claude_ai_<connector>__<tool>`."} Only claude.ai connectors are valid — locally-configured MCP servers are not. The manifest's \`tools\` array takes the connector's upstream tool names (as returned by \`listTools()\` / \`/v1/mcp_servers\`), which can differ from the normalized \`<toolName>\` segment when an upstream name contains \`.\` or spaces. In hermetic/CI sessions where connectors aren't loaded but \`$CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN\` is set, fetch the list via Bash: \`curl -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' -H 'anthropic-beta: ${MCP_SERVERS_BETA_DESCRIPTOR.header}' -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN" ${API_CONFIG_FN().BASE_API_URL}/v1/mcp_servers?limit=1000\`; in that case use each entry's \`display_name\` as the \`server\` value (exact display names are always accepted alongside tool-prefix segments).
