  Describes the SearchPlugins tool for finding relevant claude.ai org catalog
  plugins by keyword and suggesting install cards when results fit
ccVersion: 2.1.199
-->
Search the user's claude.ai plugin catalog by keyword. Call this when a plugin (slash command, skill bundle, hook, or agent) from the user's org catalog might help complete the task.

Examples:
- "use the deploy plugin" → keywords ["deploy"]
- "is there something for linting?" → keywords ["lint", "format", "code quality"]

Returns a ranked list with id, name, description, and whether the plugin is already enabled. When results fit, call SuggestPluginInstall to render the install card. If nothing relevant, proceed without mentioning that you searched.
