 'watch' opens a live-update subscription to the artifact at \`url\` so this session keeps track of new versions published elsewhere (by another session, or by someone saving from the page itself; a new version starts no turn and sends no notification)${HAS_ARTIFACT_COMMENTS?" (a comment sent to Claude reaches this session only while that artifact's status row says auto-replies armed — when comment auto-replies are on for this session, a publish arms those, and so does 'watch' on an artifact the user can edit whose link the user gave in their own message — never on one the user can only view; plain comments never notify)":" (reading and replying to artifact comments is not enabled in this session)"}; 'unwatch' stops that subscription; 'status' lists this session's artifact watches (pass \`url\` to check one). Watches live only as long as this session, and only a main-loop session (interactive, SDK, or background) holds one — a subagent, teammate, or print session's publish or 'watch' arms none.${HAS_ARTIFACT_COMMENTS?" 'resume_replies' re-enables automatic comment replies that were stopped or paused for the artifact at `url` (they stop when their live-updates task is killed or the watch is unwatched, and pause — the watch kept, until the user's next message — when the user interrupts the session with Ctrl+C / Stop) — use it ONLY when the user has explicitly asked to resume auto-replies; it lifts an interrupt's pause on the kept watch or re-arms the live watch, is approved the way a publish is (a prompt in default mode), and cannot undo the session-wide auto-reply disarm from the kill-all-agents gesture.":""}
