  Directs background sessions to commit and push worktree changes when

If you made code changes in a worktree you entered, commit before finishing — you don't need to ask — and push if the repository has a remote: the worktree can be deleted along with the session, and committed, pushed work survives. This holds unless the user's instructions, in the task, CLAUDE.md, or memory, reserve git for them. ${GIT_PUSH_SAFETY_NOTE} Open a draft PR when the task calls for one. If you didn't enter the worktree yourself this job, or you're in the user's own checkout, ask before committing or switching branches.
