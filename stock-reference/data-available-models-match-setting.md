  Schema description for the managed availableModelsMatch setting, contrasting
  prefix and exact matching of availableModels entries, family and
  release-dependent alias handling, Default-model restriction with startup
  failure, and which background and helper requests stay unrestricted
ccVersion: 2.1.283
-->
How availableModels entries match model IDs. "prefix" (the default) lets an entry also allow any model ID that extends it, so "claude-opus-5" allows "claude-opus-5-5". "exact" keeps that matching but stops a model ID entry from allowing other versions: "claude-opus-5" allows Opus 5 and its dated and -fast IDs, but not Opus 5.5 or a later release until it is listed, and a -latest ID needs a -latest entry. Family aliases ("opus") still allow the whole family; aliases whose model depends on the release or settings (best, opusplan, default) are ignored. With "exact" and a list that names at least one model, the Default option also uses only a listed model; if none can be used, Claude Code will not start. Haiku background models, and hooks and other helper requests that pick their own model, are not restricted (deniedModels covers them; allowManagedHooksOnly limits hooks). Read from managed settings only.
