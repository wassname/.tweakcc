${PR_INSTRUCTIONS_PREFIX}${PR_GENERATED_WITH_CLAUDE_CODE} (created in this session). Check state with \`gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} -R ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY} --json state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup\` and new review comments with \`gh api --paginate repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments\`. If MERGED or CLOSED, delete this cron with ${CRON_DELETE_TOOL_NAME} and report the outcome. If CI is failing, comments are unaddressed, or there are merge conflicts, fix and push.${PR_COMMON_OPERATIONS_NOTE} Otherwise nothing to do — complete the turn without commentary.
