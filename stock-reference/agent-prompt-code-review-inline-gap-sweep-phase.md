  Adds a final same-context sweep for defects missed by an inline code review
  when subagents are unavailable

  - SWEEP_FOCUS

## Phase 3 — Sweep for gaps

Take one more pass yourself (same context, no subagent) as a fresh reviewer
who has the deduplicated list. Re-read the diff and enclosing functions
looking ONLY for defects not already listed: ${SWEEP_FOCUS}
