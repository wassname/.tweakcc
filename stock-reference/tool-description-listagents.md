name: 'Tool Description: ListAgents'
description: >-
  Describes the ListAgents tool, which lists agents you can message — in-process
  subagents, teammates, other local and cloud Claude sessions, and remote bridge
  sessions
ccVersion: 2.1.239
variables:
  - SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME
-->
Lists agents you can ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} to — in-process subagents you spawned, the teammates on your team, other local Claude sessions on this machine, your Claude sessions running in the cloud (when this session has cloud access; a cloud session receives your message but cannot message any session back yet — do not ask it to reply, read its answer in its own transcript), and (when Remote Control is connected here) your account's other sessions — Remote Control sessions on other machines and cloud sessions, each row labeled by kind. Names are the address: send with \`${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME}({to: "<name>", message: "..."})\`, copying the name exactly as a row prints it. Append a row's \` [ref]\` only when the bare name is not enough — two rows share it, or an error asks you to disambiguate.
