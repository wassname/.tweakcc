name: 'Data: Artifact capability verification pass'
description: >-
  Requires one functional pass over a page's session-declared runtime
  capabilities before handing over its link, assembling the preview, database
  read and endpoint checks to run and what to report to the user
ccVersion: 2.1.283
variables:
  - ARTIFACT_TOOL_AVAILABILITY
  - ARTIFACT_FEATURE_GATES
  - ARTIFACT_CHECK_TOOL_NAME
  - CAPABILITY_VERIFICATION_CLAUSES
  - IS_TRUTHY_FN

## Verify before you hand over the link — this session

A page whose \`capabilities\` you declared in this session gets one functional pass, not a render loop: ${[ARTIFACT_TOOL_AVAILABILITY.check&&ARTIFACT_FEATURE_GATES()?`before publishing, one \`${ARTIFACT_CHECK_TOOL_NAME}\` preview of the page (capabilities are unavailable in the preview, so that code does not run there)`:"",...CAPABILITY_VERIFICATION_CLAUSES].filter(IS_TRUTHY_FN).join("; ")}. Then tell the user in one line what you exercised and what you could not. An Artifact made from an Artifact type is not such a page: its capabilities come from the type, and the type's instructions govern any checking.
