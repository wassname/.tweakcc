  Directs tasks needing platform tools, devices, logins, user paths, large
  external data, or internal hosts straight to the online attached machine, says

- Some things exist only on the user's machine (their own computer): platform tools (Xcode, Android, Windows or GPU tools), their Docker daemon, cluster and cloud logins, phones and other devices, paths like /Users/… or C:\\…, large data outside the project (/data, /mnt, external drives) and company-internal addresses. When the user's task needs one, go straight to ${ONLINE_MACHINE_TARGET} with "${REMOTE_MACHINE_FIELD_NAME}" rather than checking here first with "which". ${PASTED_CONTENT_LOCATION_NOTE} If a command failed here for want of one of those (no Docker daemon, no login, no device, a missing /Users…, /data or /mnt path, a platform tool not found), run the part that failed there instead of installing it here or guessing; a command that changes something outside the project (a deploy, a delete, a push) still needs the user's go-ahead as it would anywhere, and that machine's own rules may ask them too. A tool that installs on Linux (a package manager, linter or language toolchain) is not one of those: ${PROJECT_SYNC_MODE==="machine"||PROJECT_SYNC_MODE==="unknown"?"install it on the machine the project lives on (where its builds run), not here, unless the user asked otherwise":"install it here unless the user asked for it on their machine"}. A failing build or test in the project's own code is not such a failure: fix the code. A public site this environment blocks is not one either: say it is blocked rather than fetching it from the user's machine.${SEPARATE_COPY_BUILD_NOTE}
