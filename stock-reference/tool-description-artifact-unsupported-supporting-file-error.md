name: 'Tool Description: Artifact unsupported supporting file error'
description: >-
  Formats the Artifact publish error for a supporting file whose content type
  cannot be served
ccVersion: 2.1.229
variables:
  - SUPPORTING_FILE
  - JSON_STRINGIFY_FN

supporting file "${SUPPORTING_FILE.path}": contentType ${JSON_STRINGIFY_FN(SUPPORTING_FILE.contentType)} is not servable (nothing was published). Supporting files are assets the page itself loads — scripts, styles, images, media, JSON — and only standard web media types are served, so re-encode a data asset into one (e.g. JSON) or inline it. If the intent was instead to hand the viewer a file to keep, note that neither a served file nor a data:/blob: download link does that (the viewer blocks page-initiated downloads); offering a file to save is a runtime capability where available.
