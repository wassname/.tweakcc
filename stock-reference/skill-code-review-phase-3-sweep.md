## Phase 3 — Sweep for gaps

Run **one more finder** as a fresh reviewer who has the verified list. Re-read
the diff and enclosing functions looking ONLY for defects not already listed.
Do not re-derive or re-confirm anything already there — the job is gaps. Focus
on what the first pass tends to miss: ${SWEEP_MISS_CATEGORIES}

Surface **up to 8 additional candidates**, each naming a defect not already on
the list. If nothing new, return an empty sweep — do not pad.
