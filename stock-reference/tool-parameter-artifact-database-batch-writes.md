write_db with db_op 'batch' only: the writes to apply together, 1-${MAX_BATCH_DATABASE_WRITES} entries of {op: 'set'|'update'|'delete', collection, doc_id, and for set/update exactly one of data (inline object) or file_path (a local JSON file)${HAS_ARTIFACT_DB_STR_REPLACE?", plus if_version — that document's last-read `version` (optional; omit it only for a document you have not read); if any pinned document has changed since, the whole batch writes nothing and the result names the entry and its current version":""}}. Each document is addressed at most once; the batch commits all-or-nothing where the server supports it, else ${HAS_ARTIFACT_DB_STR_REPLACE?"(a batch with no pinned entry) ":""}in order one at a time (the result says which). Prefer it over separate write_db calls whenever you write more than a couple of documents.
