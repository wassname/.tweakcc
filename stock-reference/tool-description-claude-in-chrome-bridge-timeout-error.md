The "${CHROME_TOOL_NAME}" tool did not respond in time. The Chrome extension is connected but the page may be loading, unresponsive, or waiting on a permission prompt in the extension side panel. Try a lighter operation (e.g., "get_page_text" instead of a screenshot) or ask the user to check the page and any pending prompts.
