  Schema description for the internal set_model system_prompt field, including
  next-turn application with unchanged tool definitions, non-empty updates,
  feature overrides, and compatibility behavior
ccVersion: 2.1.280
-->
@internal Replaces the custom system prompt (the --system-prompt / initialize systemPrompt slot). The session keeps sending the system prompt it has recorded, so the new text is first sent after the next compaction; under systemPromptSnapshot: false it is sent from the next turn on. The tool definitions already sent do not change. Applied only when the model request is accepted; must be non-empty (there is no revert-to-built-in form); re-send the current model for a prompt-only update; sending the text already in effect changes nothing. The CLAUDE_CODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_GB_FEATURE per-turn read, where configured, still wins. Transports that do not implement it, and older builds, ack success without applying it.
