  Describes the browser navigate tool for opening URLs and moving forward or
  backward in tab history
ccVersion: 2.1.211

Navigate to a URL, or go forward/back in browser history. tabId may be omitted for URL navigation when calling navigate STANDALONE (not inside browser_batch): tabs_context_mcp{createIfEmpty:true} is called for you and the first tab in the session's group is navigated — its result is appended to this call's output so you have the tab list and ids for subsequent calls. Inside browser_batch, navigate (and other tools that act on a page) requires an explicit tabId. Pass an explicit tabId when you need a specific tab or when the session's group has multiple tabs whose state you must preserve. tabId is required for url:"back"/"forward".
