  Documents the mcp_read_resource control request that reads one MCP Apps
  (SEP-1865) ui:// resource from a connected MCP server, its sandboxed-render
  requirement, SDK-server rejection, refused lanes and error cases
ccVersion: 2.1.280
-->
Reads one MCP Apps (SEP-1865) UI resource — a `ui://` URI, typically the `_meta.ui.resourceUri` a tool declares — from a connected MCP server the CLI itself dialed, with `resources/read`, for a host that renders it. Read-only and no model turn. The reply is untrusted third-party content (HTML): render it sandboxed. SDK-type MCP servers (config.type === "sdk") are rejected — they are caller-provided, so the caller can read them directly. Errors name the cause: a non-ui:// URI, an unknown server, a server that managed policy blocks, that is disabled or that the project has not approved (the refusals mcp_reconnect gives), a server that is not connected (failed, pending or needs-auth: send mcp_reconnect; a connected server, or one still listed from the discovery cache, is read through the same connect path a tool call takes), a response over the size limit, or the server's own resources/read error. Refused on a lane that redacts what it persists (a Remote Control bridge worker, a tenant worker) and by the client of a cloud-hosted session. Advertised as `mcp_read_resource_v1` in system/init.capabilities.
