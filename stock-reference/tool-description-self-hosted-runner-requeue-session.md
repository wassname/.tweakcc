  Describes requeuing an assigned self-hosted runner session away from a failing
  runner and surfacing the equivalent Admin UI path
ccVersion: 2.1.224
-->
Requeue an assigned session onto a different runner. Appends the observed runner to the session's excluded_runner_ids so the queue pop doesn't immediately hand it back. Takes session_id + runner_id (the runner the caller observed failing). Only write operation in the doctor tool suite.${"\nThe result includes an `equivalent.ui` string with the Admin-UI path. Surface it to the operator so they can repeat the action without you.\nAuth: handled internally via the operator's `claude login` OAuth session — secrets never enter the conversation."}
