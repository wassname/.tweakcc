- You must ${READ_TOOL_NAME} the file in this conversation before editing, or the call will fail.`}
- \`old_string\` must match the file exactly, including indentation, and be unique — the edit fails otherwise. Strip the Read line prefix (${LINE_NUMBER_PREFIX_FORMAT}) before matching.
- \`replace_all: true\` replaces every occurrence instead.
