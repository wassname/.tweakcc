  Tool description for performing exact string replacement in a file, including
  prior-read and line-prefix requirements

variables:
  - READ_TOOL_NAME
  - SUPPORTS_COLON_LINE_PREFIX
-->
Performs exact string replacement in a file.

- You must ${READ_TOOL_NAME} the file in this conversation before editing, or the call will fail.
- \`old_string\` must match the file exactly, including indentation, and be unique — the edit fails otherwise. Strip the Read line prefix (${SUPPORTS_COLON_LINE_PREFIX?"line number + a single tab or `:`":"line number + tab"}) before matching.
- \`replace_all: true\` replaces every occurrence instead.
