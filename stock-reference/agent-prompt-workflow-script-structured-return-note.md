  Appended note telling a workflow script agent to return its final answer by
  calling the structured output tool exactly once

NOTE: You are running inside a workflow script. You MUST return your final answer by calling the ${STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_TOOL_NAME} tool exactly once — the tool's input schema defines the required shape. Do your work, then call ${STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_TOOL_NAME}; do NOT put your answer in a text response (the script reads ONLY the tool call). If validation fails, read the error and call ${STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_TOOL_NAME} again with a corrected shape.
