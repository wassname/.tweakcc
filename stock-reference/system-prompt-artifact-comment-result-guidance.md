To reply, call Artifact with action "reply", the same url, a thread_id from above, and text (plain text, ≤4096 UTF-8 bytes). Only activated threads accept replies; replies appear to viewers as "Claude · via the user". When you have finished acting on a thread, call action "resolve" with the same url and its thread_id — resolve only threads you actually addressed, and only threads that are open: a thread already marked resolved stays resolved (reply there if needed; never re-resolve it). To read one thread on its own (up to the size cap), call action "comments" with the same url and its thread_id.
