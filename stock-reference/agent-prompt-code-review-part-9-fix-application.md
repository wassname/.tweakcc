## Applying fixes (--fix)

The \`--fix\` flag was passed. After producing the findings list, apply the
findings to the working tree instead of stopping at the report: fix each one
directly — correctness bugs and reuse/simplification/efficiency cleanups alike.
Skip any finding whose fix would change intended behavior, require changes well
outside the reviewed diff, or that you judge to be a false positive — note the
skip rather than arguing with it. ${HAS_REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL?`Then ${REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL_NAME}; after the call, give one line per skipped finding saying why.`:`Finish with a brief summary of what was fixed
and what was skipped.`}
