  Additional Edit guidance to keep old_string minimal and unique or use
  replace_all
ccVersion: 2.1.173

- Keep `old_string` minimal — usually 1-3 lines, only enough to be unique in the file. Including excess context wastes tokens and is an error.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. In that case, add the minimum extra context needed for uniqueness, or use `replace_all` to change every instance.
