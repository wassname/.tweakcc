description: >-
  Explains outbound file sync at turn end and before remote calls, delayed
  inbound reconciliation between tool calls with a notice, and directs reading
  fresh or git-ignored files on the remote machine itself

  - REMOTE_FILE_READ_GUIDANCE

- File sync timing: edit here, in the synced copy; your edits reach ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} at the end of your turn and just before each call you run on ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME}. What a call you run on ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} creates or changes there is usually sent back as it finishes and taken in here between your tool calls once it has landed, with a notice — ${"not necessarily by your next step; so until that notice comes"}, read a command's new output on ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME}, not here, possibly for the whole turn. Edits the user makes on ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} during your turn can also arrive between your tool calls, with a notice. Files git ignores never cross either way — read those, and anything not yet here, on ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} itself (have the command print it, or ${REMOTE_FILE_READ_GUIDANCE}).
