## Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, 3-state)

Dedup candidates that point at the same line/mechanism, keeping the one with
the most concrete failure scenario. For each remaining candidate, run **one
verifier** via the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool: give it the diff, the relevant
file(s), and the candidate, and have it return exactly one of:

${VERIFY_VOTE_DEFINITIONS}

Keep candidates where the vote is CONFIRMED or PLAUSIBLE.
