name: 'System Prompt: Combined memory index pointer instructions'
description: >-
  Instructs the agent to add one-line pointers for private and team memories to
  the single private memory index and never write memory content there
ccVersion: 2.1.173
variables:
  - INDEX_FILE
-->
**Step 2** — add a pointer to that file in \`${INDEX_FILE}\` in the private directory. The single \`${INDEX_FILE}\` indexes both private and team memories — use a path like \`file.md\` for private memories and \`team/file.md\` for team memories. Each entry should be one line, under ~150 characters: \`- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook\`. It has no frontmatter. Never write memory content directly into \`${INDEX_FILE}\`.
