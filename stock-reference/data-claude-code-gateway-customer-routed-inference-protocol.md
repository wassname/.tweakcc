## Customer-routed inference

This deployment accepts customer-routed inference (CRI) callers: Claude
Enterprise clients that authenticate with a short-lived, audience-bound
CRI JWT minted by Anthropic instead of a gateway session token. These
rules are the contract any gateway (this one or third-party software)
must honor to serve such clients.

**Authentication.** The client sends \`Authorization: Bearer <token>\` where
the token is a compact JWS with header \`typ: "cri+jwt"\`, \`alg: ES256\`,
and a \`kid\` naming a key in Anthropic's published CRI JWKS. The issuer
is \`https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/cri\`: its OIDC-style discovery
document at \`{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration\` names the
\`jwks_uri\` (\`{issuer}/jwks.json\`), so configure your verifier from the
issuer alone or pin that JWKS URL directly. Verify each token
entirely offline — no per-request call to Anthropic — and admit the
caller only when ALL of: the ES256 signature verifies against Anthropic's
CRI JWKS (accept no other algorithm, and use no other key set for tokens
of this type); \`iss\` is exactly the issuer above; \`typ\` is
exactly \`cri+jwt\`; \`aud\` matches an audience value registered for YOUR
gateway (reject every other audience — this is what stops a token minted
for another org's gateway from replaying here); \`exp\`/\`nbf\` hold
(allow ~60s clock skew); \`scope\` is \`"inference"\`; and the token's
\`org\` claim is an organization you have explicitly allowlisted. Tokens
are short-lived (minutes) and carry the caller's identity in \`sub\`
(hosted sessions: \`sub = "ccr:<session>"\` with the acting user in
\`act.sub\`) — record them in your audit log. Verify at ADMISSION ONLY:
let an in-flight streaming response that crosses \`exp\` complete.
Refresh the JWKS periodically, honoring its cache headers, and refetch
(bounded by a cooldown) on an unknown \`kid\`; when you cannot obtain a
current-enough key set — never fetched, or stale past a hard ceiling
(hours) — fail CLOSED with \`503\` on the CRI paths, not \`401\`, so
clients back off instead of discarding tokens that may be fine. CRI
callers may use \`POST /v1/messages\` and
\`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens\` only.

**Forwarding.** Every upstream leg — Anthropic or cloud — runs on YOUR
OWN upstream credential. Never forward the caller's \`Authorization\`
header to any upstream: the CRI JWT is a gateway-admission credential
with no meaning beyond your wall, and nothing else the caller sends is a
credential at all. (The earlier revision of this contract had an
Anthropic-side credential-relay mode — "auth passthrough" — which is
REMOVED; per-user metering at Anthropic's edge is deferred to a future
token-exchange design.)

**Response hygiene.** On every response, strip the upstream's identity,
quota, and infra headers (\`request-id\`, \`anthropic-organization-id\`,
\`anthropic-ratelimit-*\`, \`cf-ray\`, \`via\`) before the wire: every
upstream answers as YOU, so those headers describe your deployment and
quota, never the caller's.

**Errors.** The HTTP status is always preserved. For CRI callers,
replace the error body with a generic envelope that keeps the status
and an accurate \`error.type\` — your upstream's raw error pages can
carry internal hostnames and banners, so never relay them. One
obligation comes with that: the client recovers from an upstream
rejecting a capability by matching \`status === 400\` (plus one 413
variant) and the upstream's own error wording, which your replacement
hides. So before replacing a \`400\` or \`413\` body, classify the
upstream's message and, when it matches a class below, make your
envelope's \`error.message\` the stable token
\`capability_rejected: <class>\` — the client matches the token exactly
as it would the wording, and the session self-heals instead of
stranding. A message matching no class gets your generic copy. (Where
your gateway authors the error body itself — e.g. a cloud-SDK leg —
classify the SDK error's message the same way.)

| Class (in classification order) | Upstream meaning (what to classify) |
|---|---|
| \`mid_conv_system\` | A mid-conversation \`{role:"system"}\` message was rejected — the role itself, where the message is placed, or a cache breakpoint on it |
| \`cache_control_field\` | The \`cache_control\` field itself was rejected by schema validation, with no system-message wording |
| \`thinking_signature\` | A thinking block's signature, or a \`redacted_thinking\` block's \`data\`, was rejected ("Invalid signature in thinking block", "Invalid data in redacted_thinking block", "…cannot be modified", a \`…thinking.signature: Field required\` path) — the client strips thinking blocks and retries |
| \`thinking_type:<enabled\\|adaptive>\` | The \`thinking.type\` value was rejected ("thinking.type: enabled …is not supported", "adaptive thinking is not supported…"); \`<enabled\\|adaptive>\` names the rejected value (lowercased) so the client can swap off it |
| \`effort_unsupported\` | The effort parameter / per-turn \`output_config\` was rejected ("This model does not support the effort parameter", \`output_config…\` "Extra inputs are not permitted" / "requires a model that supports…") — the client drops effort (and, from the next turn, the per-turn statements) |
| \`media_budget\` | The combined media budget was exceeded ("Too much media: N document pages + M images > B") — the client strips both media kinds |
| \`image_block\` | An image content block was rejected ("Could not process image", size/dimension limits, a \`messages.N.content.M.image…\` path) |
| \`document_block\` | A PDF/document block was rejected ("Could not process PDF", page limits, a \`…document\` path) |
| \`prompt_too_long\` | "Prompt is too long" / "Input is too long for requested model" (either status), or a 413 naming the model context window |
| \`max_tokens_context_overflow\` | "input length and \`max_tokens\` exceed context limit: …" |
| \`beta_header:<value>\` | The upstream rejected an \`anthropic-beta\` value the caller sent; \`<value>\` is that caller-sent value, verbatim |

The token is the whole \`error.message\` — nothing else in it. The table
is ordered: where a wording matches more than one row, the earlier row
wins — in particular, a rejection of the mid-conversation-system beta
value classifies as \`mid_conv_system\`, not \`beta_header:…\`. Classes are
append-only contract; classify conservatively (a wording you cannot
confidently classify takes the generic copy — a wrong token triggers
the wrong client recovery).

**Blocking.** To refuse a request on content policy, respond

    HTTP 400
    x-should-retry: false
    {"type":"error","request_id":"<id>","error":{"type":"policy_blocked","message":"<shown to the user>"}}

and do not forward it. Put the id your audit row is keyed by in
\`request_id\`: the message is rendered to a developer who cannot see your
logs, and the id is what they quote to you to find the block. The client
keys on \`error.type\` (any status, and a
status-less mid-stream \`event: error\` routes the same), renders the
message with no retry and no sign-in prompt, and never substitutes a
fallback model. Never rewrite a request or response body instead — blocking
substitutes the whole response; modification poisons prompt caching and
diverges the client's view of the conversation.

**Discovery additions.** This deployment's
\`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\` carries one extra field:
\`cri_enabled: true\` (CRI callers are accepted). The earlier
\`cri_passthrough\` and \`first_party_compatible\` fields are RETIRED with
the credential-relay mode — no deployment can truthfully advertise a
verbatim first-party wire surface when every request rides an operator
credential.

**Endpoint shape.** The client is configured with an origin-root base URL
and posts to fixed paths under it, with query strings it controls (e.g.
\`/v1/messages?beta=true\`) — match on the path, tolerate the query.
Clients also send telemetry to Anthropic directly; it does not traverse
this gateway.
