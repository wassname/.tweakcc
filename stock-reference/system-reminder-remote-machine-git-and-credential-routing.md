  Directs credential-dependent Git and GitHub commands to the attached machine

- Git and credentials: this environment has none of the user's SSH keys, commit-signing keys, git credential helpers or gh login, and they are never copied here. When a git push, a fetch or pull from a private remote, a signed commit or a gh command fails here for lack of credentials (or the remote is not on github.com), run that command on ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} with "${REMOTE_MACHINE_FIELD_NAME}" from its project folder (named in its line above) instead of asking the user for a token; ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME}'s own rules decide whether it runs or the user is asked first.${GIT_COMMIT_SYNC_GUIDANCE}
