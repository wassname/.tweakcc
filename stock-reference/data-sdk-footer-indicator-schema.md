  Schema description for the SDK footer indicator, its environment-variable and
  cached-bootstrap sources, and its delivery on system/init and initialize
  responses so host UIs can render the terminal status pill
ccVersion: 2.1.274
-->
@internal The session indicator (the CLAUDE_CODE_FOOTER_INDICATOR environment variable, else bootstrap client_data.footer_indicator) that the terminal renders as a "◆ <text>" pill in the prompt footer — an opaque status note operators set per cohort (e.g. to prove a test config reached the session). Carried on `system/init` and the `initialize` response so a host UI (Claude Desktop, IDE webviews) can render the same pill. Absent when nothing is configured; hosts should then render nothing. The client_data source is read from the CLI's cached bootstrap data, so a label configured there after that cache was last written first appears on a later `system/init`.
