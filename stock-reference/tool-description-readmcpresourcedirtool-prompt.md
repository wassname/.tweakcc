  Tool prompt for listing direct children of an MCP directory resource and
  explaining the required server and uri parameters
ccVersion: 2.1.186
variables:
  - DIRECTORY_MIME_TYPE
-->

List the direct children of a directory resource on an MCP server (\`resources/directory/read\`).

Parameters:
- server (required): The name of the MCP server to read from
- uri (required): The URI of the directory resource

The listing is not recursive. Each entry carries its own \`uri\`; subdirectories appear with mimeType "${DIRECTORY_MIME_TYPE}" — call this tool again on a subdirectory's \`uri\` to descend.

Only usable against a server that has declared support for directory listing; other servers return an error.
