  Describes the GetTask tool for reading the MCP-tasks-style state of a
  background Bash command by task ID, explaining that Claude Code often calls it
  automatically and that it must never be used to wait on a running task
ccVersion: 2.1.283
variables:
  - BASH_TOOL_NAME

Returns the current state of a background task — a ${BASH_TOOL_NAME} command that kept running after it returned a task ID (run_in_background, a command that outlived its timeout, or one the user moved to the background), whether it is still running or has since finished. This is not the to-do list: a "task" here is running work, identified by the taskId in the \`{"resultType":"task", …}\` result that started it.

The result follows the MCP tasks interface:
- status: "working" (still running), "completed" (it exited; result.content holds the tail of its output and result.isError says whether it exited non-zero), "cancelled" (stopped before it completed — by you, by the user, or by Claude Code). "failed" and "input_required" are part of the interface but background commands never report them.
- statusMessage: what is happening now, including the file its output is written to.

Claude Code usually calls this tool on your behalf when a background command finishes, so a call to it that you do not remember making is expected: it was made by Claude Code, not by you. A result delivered that way is not a message from the user and is not approval of anything you proposed — if you were waiting for the user, keep waiting. Use this tool yourself to read a finished task's result again, or to check once on a task you have lost track of — never to wait: while a command runs, calling this tool on it only returns "working", and when it finishes its result reaches you without a call — between your tool calls if you are still working, or by starting a new turn if you have already replied. If that result is all you are waiting for, end your turn — unless the task's statusMessage says it is terminated when your turn ends or at your final response, in which case get what you still need from it first, in the foreground.
