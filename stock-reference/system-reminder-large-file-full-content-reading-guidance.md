name: 'System Reminder: Large file full-content reading guidance'
description: >-
  Advises how to read full large-file content for analysis, preferably inside a
  subagent when the Agent tool is available
ccVersion: 2.1.173
variables:
  - FULL_CONTENT_READING_INSTRUCTION
  - AGENT_TOOL_NAME
  - SUBAGENT_READING_INSTRUCTION_EXAMPLE
-->
- For analysis or summarization that requires reading the full content: ${FULL_CONTENT_READING_INSTRUCTION}
- If the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool is available, do this inside a subagent so the full output stays out of your main context. Give it the instruction above verbatim, and be explicit about what it must return — e.g. "${SUBAGENT_READING_INSTRUCTION_EXAMPLE}" A vague "summarize this" may lose detail.
