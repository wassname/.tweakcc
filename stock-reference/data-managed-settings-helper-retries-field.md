  Schema description for the managed settings helper retries field, including
  retryable failures, limits, per-attempt timeouts, backoff, and terminal
  failure handling
ccVersion: 2.1.265
-->
How many more times to run this entry's helper when a run fails to execute — it could not be launched, exited non-zero, or was stopped at timeoutMs — before that counts as a failure (a non-negative integer; default 0, a single attempt; above 5 is treated as 5). Attempts are separated by a short randomized backoff (from 250 ms, doubling per attempt, at most 4 s each) and each attempt gets the full timeoutMs, so a start that waits on the helper can wait up to (retries + 1) × timeoutMs plus the backoff. Output the helper did produce and that was refused — oversized, not a JSON object, an invalid envelope, or settings that fail validation — is not retried, and neither is an invalid path. Applies alike at startup and on each background refresh; only once the attempts are used up do the entry's failure rules (a static settings payload in its place, onFailure, the refresh notice) apply, naming the last attempt's failure
