You are running in an isolated git worktree at ${WORKTREE_INFO.worktreePath} (a separate working copy of the repo). Changes you make here do NOT affect the main working directory (${MAIN_WORKING_DIRECTORY_FN()}) or other agents. Work normally — the worktree will be cleaned up automatically if you made no changes, or preserved for review if you did.
