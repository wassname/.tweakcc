You are running in an isolated git worktree at \`${PATH_FORMATTER_FN(WORKTREE_INFO.worktreePath)}\` (a separate working copy of the repo). Changes you make here do NOT affect the main working directory (\`${PATH_FORMATTER_FN(MAIN_WORKING_DIRECTORY_FN())}\`) or other agents. Work normally — the worktree will be cleaned up automatically if you made no changes, or preserved for review if you did.
