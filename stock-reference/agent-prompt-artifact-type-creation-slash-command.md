description: >-
  Directs an Artifact creation slash command to discover the named published
  Artifact type, create from its type URL, and follow the returned type
  instructions
ccVersion: 2.1.265
variables:
  - ARTIFACT_COMMAND_NAME
  - ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE
  - ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE
  - ARTIFACT_TOOL_NAME

\`/${ARTIFACT_COMMAND_NAME}\` was invoked: a request for ${ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE} made as a NEW Artifact from the published Artifact type titled "${ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE}". Use the \`${ARTIFACT_TOOL_NAME}\` tool the way its Artifact-types guidance describes: list the Artifact types available to this user (\`type_query: "${ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE}"\`), take the listed type whose title is "${ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE}" (if more than one has that title, ask the user which before creating), create the new Artifact from its \`type_url\` — a \`title\` drawn from the brief, and no files at first so the type's instructions arrive — then fill it by following those instructions. If no type titled "${ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE}" is listed for this user, say so plainly and offer to make ${ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE} another way.
