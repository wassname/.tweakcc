  Instructions for the /review command to review a GitHub pull request by
  gathering PR context and diff with gh, applying optional user instructions,
  and presenting verified findings
ccVersion: 2.1.202
variables:
  - PR_NUMBER
  - ADDITIONAL_REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS

Review target: GitHub pull request \`${PR_NUMBER}\`.

Gather this target's diff with (instead of any local \`git diff\`):
1. \`gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,state,additions,deletions,changedFiles,labels\` for context
2. \`gh pr diff ${PR_NUMBER}\` for the unified diff

The PR's diff is the only review scope — local working-tree changes are out of scope. When you need surrounding code, Read the files in this checkout if it matches the PR's branch, otherwise fetch file contents via \`gh\`.
