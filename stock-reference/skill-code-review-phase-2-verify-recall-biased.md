  Recall-tier verification step: one verifier per candidate finding, biased

## Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, recall-biased)

Dedup near-duplicates (same defect, same location, same reason → keep one). For
each remaining candidate, run **one verifier** via the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool:
give it the diff, the relevant file(s), and the candidate; it returns exactly
one of **CONFIRMED / PLAUSIBLE / REFUTED**.

${RECALL_BIASED_RUBRIC}

Keep **CONFIRMED and PLAUSIBLE**. Drop REFUTED.
