name: 'System Reminder: Directory sync restored files mismatch'
description: >-
  Lists files whose content in this checkout no longer matches the user's
  commits after a rewind or rewrite, and directs comparing against HEAD before
  restoring or reverting a path
ccVersion: 2.1.283
variables:
  - FORMAT_PATH_LIST_FN
  - DIRECTORY_SYNC_RESULT
-->
 These files no longer match the user's commits — your rewound version or your rewrite — here and, as uncommitted changes, on the user's machine: ${FORMAT_PATH_LIST_FN(DIRECTORY_SYNC_RESULT.restored.files,{openEnded:DIRECTORY_SYNC_RESULT.restored.filesTruncated,show:ejs})}. Check \`git diff HEAD -- PATH\` first (the user may have uncommitted edits of their own there); then \`git checkout HEAD -- PATH\` puts the user's committed version back (for a file those commits deleted, remove it instead), unless undoing those commits is what the user asked for.
