  PowerShell tool guidance to prefer new commits, consider safer alternatives to
  destructive git operations, and never bypass hooks or signing without an
  explicit user request
ccVersion: 2.1.271
-->

  - For git commands:
    - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.
    - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal. Only use destructive operations when they are truly the best approach.
    - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign, -c commit.gpgsign=false) unless the user has explicitly asked for it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.
