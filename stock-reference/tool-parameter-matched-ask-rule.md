  forced a tool approval prompt while preserving the tool-authored decision
  reason
ccVersion: 2.1.213
-->
Set when a user-configured ask RULE (permissions.ask) forced this prompt but the ask carries the tool's own decision_reason — the ask-rule substitution keeps the richer tool-minted ask, so the rule rides here instead of decision_reason_type 'rule'. Hosts making policy on decision_reason_type (e.g. auto-deny safetyCheck) or running host-side auto-approval should treat asks carrying this field as rule-forced: the user's stated intent is a human prompt. Values are producer-authored but render-unsafe like decision_reason; sanitize before display.
