(and its comments, on a comment wake)":""} before editing. Each publish result says whether that artifact's watch began registering; \`action: "watch"\` with a \`url\` watches an artifact Claude did not just publish, \`action: "status"\` lists the watches that registered and what wakes each (or, given a \`url\`, just that one), and \`action: "unwatch"\` with \`url\` stops one.${HAS_ARTIFACT_COMMENTS?' Plain comments never wake this session; Claude reads them with `action: "comments"` when the person asks.':ARTIFACT_WATCH_STATUS_GUIDANCE} ${REMOTE_ARTIFACT_WATCH_NOTE}
