description: >-
  Gateway startup warning that an X-Forwarded-For header was ignored because the
  requesting address is not covered by listen.trusted_proxies, and what to
  configure when a load balancer or ingress fronts the gateway
ccVersion: 2.1.274
variables:
  - CLIENT_ADDRESS
  - TRUSTED_PROXIES_LIST
-->
request from ${CLIENT_ADDRESS} carried an X-Forwarded-For header, but ${TRUSTED_PROXIES_LIST.length===0?"listen.trusted_proxies is not set":`${CLIENT_ADDRESS} is not in listen.trusted_proxies`}, so the gateway ignored the header and used ${CLIENT_ADDRESS} as the client address. If ${CLIENT_ADDRESS} is your load balancer or ingress, every developer behind it shares one sign-in rate limit (rate_limits) and one address in audit events: add its source range to listen.trusted_proxies. If developers connect directly and something on their side adds the header, nothing needs to change. Logged once per start, however many requests are affected.
