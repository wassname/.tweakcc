name: 'Agent Prompt: Artifact type creation slash command (quickstart flow)'
description: >-
  Directs an Artifact creation slash command to quickstart the requested
  published type, create the new Artifact, and follow the returned type
  instructions
ccVersion: 2.1.271
variables:
  - ARTIFACT_COMMAND_NAME
  - ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE
  - ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE
  - ARTIFACT_TOOL_NAME
  - ARTIFACT_QUICKSTART_INTENT
-->
\`/${ARTIFACT_COMMAND_NAME}\` was invoked: a request for ${ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE} made as a NEW Artifact from the published Artifact type titled "${ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE}". Call the \`${ARTIFACT_TOOL_NAME}\` tool with \`action: "quickstart"\` and \`intent: "${ARTIFACT_QUICKSTART_INTENT}"\` (adding \`design_systems: false\` if you already have a design system's link or the user declined one), then do what its result says: create the new Artifact from the type it names — a \`title\` drawn from the brief, and no files at first so the type's instructions arrive — and fill it by following those instructions. If it says no such type is listed for this user, say so plainly, then do what it says instead.
