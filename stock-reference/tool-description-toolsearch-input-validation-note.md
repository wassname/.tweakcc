  Explains the InputValidationError failure for unfetched deferred tools and
  requires selecting named deferred tools before calling them

 Until fetched, only the name is known — there is no parameter schema, so calling the tool fails with InputValidationError. When any instruction, system reminder, or other tool's description names a deferred tool, fetch it with query "select:<name>" before calling it.
