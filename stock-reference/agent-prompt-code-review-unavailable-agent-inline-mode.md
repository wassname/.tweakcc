${AGENT_UNAVAILABLE_INSTRUCTIONS}
${DIFF_GATHERING_PHASE}## Phase 1 — Find candidates (${ANGLE_COUNT} angles, single pass)

Work through **${ANGLE_COUNT} angles** yourself, in sequence, in this same
context — do not spawn subagents. Each surfaces candidate findings with
\`file\`, \`line\`, a one-line \`summary\`, and a concrete \`failure_scenario\`.

${FINDER_ANGLES_BLOCK}
${CLEANUP_AND_ALTITUDE_CANDIDATES_NOTE}
## Phase 2 — Dedup and self-check (no subagent verify)

Dedup near-duplicates (same defect, same location, same reason → keep one).
Re-check each remaining candidate yourself against the diff before keeping it.
