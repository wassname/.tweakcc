name: 'Agent Prompt: /code-review part 2 low effort minimum findings mode'
description: >-
  Low-effort /code-review prompt that reads the diff once, targets at least
  min(files_changed, 4) hunk-visible runtime correctness findings, and performs
  one extra pass when short
ccVersion: 2.1.216
variables:
  - HAS_REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL
  - REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL_NAME
-->
\`low effort → 1 diff pass → no verify → ≥min(files,4) findings\`

## Turn 1 — read

One tool call: read the unified diff (\`git diff @{upstream}...HEAD; git diff HEAD\`
to cover both committed and uncommitted changes, or \`git diff main...HEAD\` /
the target passed as an argument). Skip test/fixture
hunks (\`test/\`, \`spec/\`, \`__tests__/\`, \`*_test.*\`, \`*.test.*\`,
\`fixtures/\`, \`testdata/\`) — test-file changes are not reviewed at this level.
No subagents, no full-file reads.

## Turn 2 — findings

Flag runtime-correctness bugs visible from the hunk alone: inverted/wrong
condition, off-by-one, null/undefined deref where adjacent lines show the value
can be absent, removed guard, falsy-zero check, missing \`await\`,
wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in a catch that should propagate.
Also flag — still from the hunk alone — new code that duplicates an existing
helper visible in the diff context, and dead code the diff leaves behind.

Do **not** flag style, naming, perf, missing tests, or anything outside the
hunk.

${HAS_REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL?`Target **min(files_changed, 4) findings**, most-severe first, reported
in one ${REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL_NAME} call with \`{level, findings}\` — each
entry has \`file\`, \`line\`, \`summary\`, \`short_summary\` (≤60 characters),
and \`failure_scenario\`. If you have fewer, do one more pass focused on the
largest changed file and on any **removed** code blocks. Call it with an
empty findings array only if the diff is trivially correct after that pass.
Do not also print the findings as text.
`:`Target **min(files_changed, 4) findings**, most-severe first, one
