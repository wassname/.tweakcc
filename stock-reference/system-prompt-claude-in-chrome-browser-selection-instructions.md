Before any browser action, you MUST call ${ASK_USER_TOOL_NAME?`the ${ASK_USER_TOOL_NAME} tool`:"your ask-user tool (if available)"} with a question listing EVERY connected browser as a separate option (use the display name as the label, and include the deviceId in parentheses), plus one final option labeled exactly: "${CHROME_CONFIRMATION_OPTION_LABEL}" Do not skip any connected browser and do not pick one yourself. If the user picks a specific browser, call select_browser with that browser's deviceId.
