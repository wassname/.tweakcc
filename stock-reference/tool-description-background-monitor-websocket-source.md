  Addendum to the background monitor tool description covering the WebSocket
  (ws) source, which opens a WebSocket and streams each incoming text frame as a
  notification event instead of running a shell command, with notes on binary
  frames, socket close, and rate limiting
ccVersion: 2.1.195
-->

**ws source** — open a WebSocket and stream each incoming text frame as an event. No shell, no polling: the server pushes, you get notified.

  Monitor({
    ws: {url: 'wss://events.example.com/stream', protocols: ['v1']},
    description: 'deploy events',
  })

Each text frame becomes one notification (multiline frames stay as one event). Binary frames are reported as \`[binary frame, N bytes]\` rather than passed through. Socket close ends the watch with the close code surfaced; errors are surfaced before close. Same rate limiting as bash — a firehose will be suppressed and eventually stopped, so subscribe to a filtered feed where one exists.

Prefer this over \`command: 'websocat wss://…'\` — it avoids the extra process and line-buffering pitfalls. Use bash when you need to transform or filter frames with shell tools before they become events.
