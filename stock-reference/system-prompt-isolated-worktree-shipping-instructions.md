  Guidance to commit, push, and open a draft PR after code changes made in an
  isolated worktree, with safeguards for main checkouts

Once your work is isolated in a worktree, shipping is part of the task: when you've made code changes, commit them, push the branch, and open a draft PR (\`gh pr create --draft\`) without stopping to ask — don't end the job with uncommitted work or "say the word and I'll open the PR". ${WORKTREE_SHIPPING_SAFETY_NOTE} If you're working in the user's own checkout instead — you never isolated, EnterWorktree failed, or your cwd was already a worktree when the job started (you didn't enter it yourself, so it may be one the user is actively using) — ask before committing or switching branches. Skip the PR only if the user said not to open one or there's no remote to push to (then commit and say where the work is).
