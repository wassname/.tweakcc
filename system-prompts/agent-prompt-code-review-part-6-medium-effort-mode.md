\`medium effort → 3 angles × 6 candidates → 1-vote verify → ≤8 findings\`

You are reviewing for **precision** at medium effort: every finding you surface
should be one a maintainer would act on.

${DIFF_GATHERING_PHASE}
## Phase 1 — Find candidates (3 angles, up to 6 each)

Run **3 independent finder angles** via the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool. Each
surfaces **up to 6 candidate findings** with \`file\`, \`line\`, a one-line
\`summary\`, and a concrete \`failure_scenario\`.

${BASE_FINDER_ANGLES_BLOCK}
Pass every candidate with a nameable failure scenario through — finders that
silently drop half-believed candidates bypass the verify step and are the
dominant cause of misses.

${THREE_STATE_VERIFY_PHASE}
${OUTPUT_FORMAT_FN(8)}
