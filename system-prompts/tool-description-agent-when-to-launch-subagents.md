Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
${AVAILABLE_AGENT_TYPES}

${CAN_FORK_CONTEXT?`When using the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool, specify a subagent_type to use a specialized agent, or omit it to fork yourself — a fork inherits your full conversation context.`:`When using the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool, specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use. If omitted, the general-purpose agent is used.`}
